## FunctionDef get_config
**Function Overview**
The `get_config` function returns a configuration dictionary containing settings for the network. This configuration includes details such as the network class, its parameters, and various operational flags.

**Parameters**

- None

**Return Values**
- A `config_dict.ConfigDict` object that contains the following attributes:
  - `network_class`: The class of the network.
  - `network_kwargs`: A dictionary containing keyword arguments for initializing the network. These include:
    - `rnn_ctor`: The constructor function for the RNN (Recurrent Neural Network).
    - `rnn_kwargs`: Keyword arguments for the RNN constructor, including:
      - `adjacency`: Normalized adjacency matrix derived from province order and MDF content.
      - `filter_size`: Size of the filter used in the network.
      - `num_cores`: Number of cores in the network.
  - `name`: Name of the network configuration.
  - `num_players`: Number of players involved in the network.
  - `area_mdf`: The map definition for the area.
  - `province_mdf`: The map definition for provinces.
  - `is_training`: A boolean indicating whether the network is in training mode.
  - `shared_filter_size`: Size of shared filters used in the network.
  - `player_filter_size`: Size of player-specific filters.
  - `num_shared_cores`: Number of shared cores in the network.
  - `num_player_cores`: Number of player-specific cores.
  - `value_mlp_hidden_layer_sizes`: Hidden layer sizes for the value MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron).
  - `actions_since_last_moves_embedding_size`: Size of the embedding used to represent actions since the last move.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `get_config` function initializes a configuration dictionary and populates it with various settings required by the network. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: A `config_dict.ConfigDict` object is created.
2. **Setting Network Class**: The `network_class` attribute is set to `network.Network`.
3. **Setting RNN Constructor and Keyword Arguments**:
   - The `rnn_ctor` attribute is set to `network.RelationalOrderDecoder`.
   - The `rnn_kwargs` dictionary contains several key-value pairs, including:
     - `adjacency`: This adjacency matrix is derived from the province order and MDF content.
     - `filter_size`: Set to 64.
     - `num_cores`: Set to 4.

4. **Setting Other Attributes**:
   - `name` is set to "delta".
   - `num_players` is set to 7.
   - `area_mdf` and `province_mdf` are set to specific map definitions (`MapMDF.BICOASTAL_MAP` and `MapMDF.STANDARD_MAP`, respectively).
   - `is_training` is set to `False`.
   - `shared_filter_size` is set to 160.
   - `player_filter_size` is set to 160.
   - `num_shared_cores` is set to 12.
   - `num_player_cores` is set to 3.
   - `value_mlp_hidden_layer_sizes` is a tuple containing the size of hidden layers in the value MLP, which is `(256,)`.
   - `actions_since_last_moves_embedding_size` is set to 10.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- The function interacts with other parts of the project through the use of classes and functions such as `network.Network`, `network.RelationalOrderDecoder`, `province_order.build_adjacency()`, `province_order.get_mdf_content()`, and `province_order.MapMDF`.

**Usage Notes**
- **Preconditions**: Ensure that all required modules (`config_dict`, `network`, `province_order`) are properly imported.
- **Performance Considerations**: The configuration settings, such as the number of cores and filter sizes, can significantly impact performance. Adjust these parameters based on specific requirements and computational resources.
- **Security Considerations**: This function does not involve any security-sensitive operations. However, ensure that sensitive data is handled securely when using this configuration in a larger system.

**Example Usage**
```python
from network import get_config

# Get the network configuration
config = get_config()

print(config)
```

This example demonstrates how to call `get_config` and print the resulting configuration dictionary.
