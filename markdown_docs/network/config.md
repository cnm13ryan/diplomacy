## FunctionDef get_config

**Function Overview**

The `get_config` function returns a configuration dictionary (`config_dict.ConfigDict`) tailored for setting up a network with specific parameters and settings.

**Parameters**

- **None**: The function does not accept any parameters.

**Return Values**

- **config_dict.ConfigDict**: A configuration dictionary containing all the necessary settings to initialize a network.

**Detailed Explanation**

The `get_config` function is designed to configure a network by populating a `ConfigDict` with various parameters and nested configurations. Here's a breakdown of its logic:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by creating an instance of `config_dict.ConfigDict`, which will hold all the configuration settings.

2. **Network Class Assignment**:
   - `config.network_class = network.Network`: This line assigns the `Network` class from the `network` module to the `network_class` attribute in the configuration dictionary. This specifies that the network being configured is an instance of the `Network` class.

3. **Network Keyword Arguments (kwargs)**:
   - The function then sets up a complex nested structure within `config.network_kwargs`, which includes several key parameters and configurations:
     - **RNN Constructor (`rnn_ctor`)**: Specifies the constructor for the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) component, set to `network.RelationalOrderDecoder`.
     - **RNN Keyword Arguments (`rnn_kwargs`)**:
       - **Adjacency Matrix**: The adjacency matrix is constructed using a series of nested functions and methods from the `province_order` module. This includes building an adjacency matrix based on map data (`province_order.build_adjacency`) and normalizing it (`network.normalize_adjacency`). The map data itself is retrieved using `province_order.get_mdf_content`, with the standard map configuration specified by `province_order.MapMDF.STANDARD_MAP`.
       - **Filter Size**: Set to 64, this parameter likely controls the size of filters used in convolutional layers.
       - **Number of Cores (`num_cores`)**: Set to 4, indicating the number of parallel processing units or cores used by the RNN.
     - Additional Parameters:
       - `name`: Set to "delta", possibly a unique identifier for this configuration.
       - `num_players`: Set to 7, representing the number of players in the network's context.
       - `area_mdf` and `province_mdf`: These are set to different map configurations (`MapMDF.BICOASTAL_MAP` and `MapMDF.STANDARD_MAP`, respectively), likely defining the geographical or thematic areas for the network.
       - `is_training`: Set to False, indicating that this configuration is not intended for training purposes but rather for inference or evaluation.
       - **Shared Filter Size (`shared_filter_size`) and Player Filter Size (`player_filter_size`)**: Both set to 160, these parameters control the size of filters used in shared and player-specific layers.
       - **Number of Shared Cores (`num_shared_cores`) and Number of Player Cores (`num_player_cores`)**: Set to 12 and 3, respectively, indicating the number of cores allocated for shared and player-specific computations.
       - **Value MLP Hidden Layer Sizes**: A tuple `(256,)`, specifying the size of hidden layers in a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) used for value estimation.
       - **Actions Since Last Moves Embedding Size**: Set to 10, controlling the dimensionality of embeddings representing actions taken since the last move.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - Finally, the function returns the fully populated configuration dictionary (`config`), which can be used to initialize and configure a network instance according to the specified settings.

**Usage Notes**

- **Complexity**: The function involves multiple nested configurations and dependencies on various modules (`network`, `province_order`). Ensure that all required modules and their methods are correctly imported and available in the runtime environment.
  
- **Performance Considerations**: The configuration includes parameters for parallel processing (e.g., number of cores), which can significantly impact performance. Adjust these settings based on the available hardware resources to optimize execution speed.

- **Limitations**: This function is tailored to a specific network architecture and configuration. It may not be directly applicable or adaptable to other types of networks without modifications.
