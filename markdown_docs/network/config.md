## FunctionDef get_config
**Function Overview**: The `get_config` function returns a configuration dictionary specifically tailored for network settings.

**Parameters**: 
- **None**: The `get_config` function does not accept any parameters. It constructs and returns a pre-defined configuration.

**Return Values**:
- **config_dict.ConfigDict**: A configuration dictionary containing all necessary parameters to initialize and configure the network, including class references and keyword arguments for various components like RNN constructors and adjacency matrices.

**Detailed Explanation**:
The `get_config` function is designed to encapsulate the creation of a complex configuration object used in setting up a network. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of its logic:

1. **Initialization**: A new instance of `config_dict.ConfigDict` is created to hold all configuration settings.
2. **Network Class Assignment**: The `network_class` attribute of the config dictionary is set to `network.Network`, indicating that this class will be used as the network's base class.
3. **Keyword Arguments Configuration**:
   - A nested call to `config_dict.create()` constructs a dictionary of keyword arguments (`rnn_kwargs`) for an RNN constructor specified by `rnn_ctor=network.RelationalOrderDecoder`.
   - The adjacency matrix is generated using several nested function calls:
     - `province_order.get_mdf_content(province_order.MapMDF.STANDARD_MAP)` retrieves content from a standard map file.
     - This content is then used to build an adjacency matrix via `province_order.build_adjacency()`.
     - Finally, the adjacency matrix is normalized with `network.normalize_adjacency()` before being assigned to `rnn_kwargs`.
   - Other parameters such as `filter_size`, `num_cores`, and others are directly specified in the dictionary.
4. **Return**: The fully populated configuration dictionary (`config`) is returned.

**Usage Notes**:
- **Limitations**: The function does not allow for dynamic adjustments of its output, as it returns a static configuration based on predefined constants and methods.
- **Edge Cases**: The function assumes that all referenced modules (`network`, `province_order`, `config_dict`) are correctly imported and contain the expected functions and classes. Any changes in these modules could lead to runtime errors if not handled appropriately.
- **Potential Areas for Refactoring**:
  - **Extract Method**: To improve readability, consider extracting complex logic into smaller functions. For example, the creation of the adjacency matrix could be moved to a separate function named `create_adjacency_matrix()`.
  - **Configuration Management**: If there is a need to support multiple configurations or dynamic configuration changes, consider implementing a more flexible configuration management system.
  - **Parameterization**: To enhance modularity and maintainability, parameters such as map types (`province_order.MapMDF.STANDARD_MAP`, `province_order.MapMDF.BICOASTAL_MAP`) could be passed as arguments to the function, allowing for greater flexibility in its usage.
