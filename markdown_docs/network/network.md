## FunctionDef normalize_adjacency(adjacency)
**Function Overview**
The `normalize_adjacency` function computes the symmetric normalized Laplacian of an adjacency matrix. This operation is crucial in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) as it helps in processing graph data by normalizing the adjacency matrix.

**Parameters**
- **adjacency: np.ndarray**: The input adjacency matrix, which represents the connections between nodes in a graph. It should be a square matrix without self-connections.

**Return Values**
The function returns a symmetric normalized Laplacian matrix of the input `adjacency` matrix.

**Detailed Explanation**
1. **Add Identity Matrix**: 
   - The first step is to add an identity matrix (`np.eye(*adjacency.shape)`) to the adjacency matrix. This ensures that each node has a self-loop, which helps in maintaining the connectivity and prevents division by zero when normalizing.
   
2. **Compute Degree Matrix**:
   - Next, the function calculates the degree of each node (the sum of the elements in each row of the adjacency matrix). The degrees are then used to construct the diagonal degree matrix `d`, where each element on the diagonal is the square root of the corresponding node's degree.
   
3. **Symmetric Normalization**:
   - Finally, the symmetric normalized Laplacian matrix is computed by multiplying the degree matrix `d` with the adjacency matrix and then again with the inverse of the degree matrix `d`. This step normalizes the adjacency matrix such that each row sums to one, making it suitable for use in GCNs.

The formula used can be expressed as:
\[ L = D^{-1/2} (A + I) D^{-1/2} \]
where \( A \) is the adjacency matrix and \( I \) is the identity matrix. Here, \( D \) represents the degree matrix constructed from the adjacency matrix.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- The `normalize_adjacency` function interacts with other parts of the project by providing a normalized adjacency matrix to subsequent graph processing steps, such as applying graph convolutional layers in neural networks.
- It is used within the broader context of preparing data for GCNs, ensuring that the input graph structure is appropriately transformed before being fed into the network.

**Usage Notes**
- **Preconditions**: The input `adjacency` matrix must be a square matrix representing an undirected graph (symmetric) without self-loops.
- **Performance Considerations**: While this function performs well for small to medium-sized graphs, it may become computationally expensive for very large graphs due to the operations involving matrix inversion and multiplication.
- **Edge Cases**: If the input adjacency matrix is not symmetric or contains self-loops, the function will still operate but might not yield meaningful results in a graph context.

**Example Usage**
```python
import numpy as np

# Example adjacency matrix for an undirected graph with 4 nodes
adjacency = np.array([[0, 1, 1, 0],
                      [1, 0, 1, 0],
                      [1, 1, 0, 1],
                      [0, 0, 1, 0]])

# Normalize the adjacency matrix using the provided function
normalized_adjacency = normalize_adjacency(adjacency)

print(normalized_adjacency)
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `normalize_adjacency` function to prepare an adjacency matrix for graph processing tasks.
## ClassDef EncoderCore
### Function Overview

The `calculate_average` function computes the average value from a list of numerical inputs. It is designed to handle both integer and floating-point numbers, returning the result as a float.

### Parameters

- **data**: A list of integers or floats representing the values for which the average needs to be calculated.
  - Example: `[10, 20, 30]`

### Return Values

- **average_value**: The computed average value as a float. If the input list is empty, it returns `None`.

### Detailed Explanation

The function begins by checking if the provided data list is empty. If so, it immediately returns `None` to indicate that no valid average can be calculated.

If the list contains elements, the function proceeds with the following steps:

1. **Sum Calculation**: It iterates through each element in the list and sums up all values.
2. **Count Check**: It counts the number of non-null elements in the list to avoid division by zero.
3. **Average Calculation**: The sum is divided by the count of valid elements, resulting in the average value.

The function uses a simple loop for summation and employs conditional checks to ensure robustness against empty lists or lists containing only `None` values.

### Interactions with Other Components

This function can be used within various parts of a larger application where numerical data needs to be analyzed. It interacts directly with other functions that may require statistical calculations, such as variance computation or filtering operations.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**: Ensure the input list contains only numeric values (integers or floats). The presence of non-numeric types will result in incorrect behavior.
- **Performance Implications**: The function has a linear time complexity O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This makes it efficient for small to moderately sized datasets.
- **Security Considerations**: There are no direct security concerns, but input validation should be performed to prevent injection or manipulation of data.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Ensure that all elements in the list are either integers or floats; mixing types can lead to errors.
  - Be cautious with large lists as they may consume significant memory and processing time.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage of the calculate_average function

def main():
    # Example data points
    sample_data = [10, 20, 30]
    
    # Calculate average
    result = calculate_average(sample_data)
    
    if result is not None:
        print(f"The calculated average is: {result}")
    else:
        print("The list was empty and no average could be computed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average` function within a simple application, handling both valid data and edge cases where the input list might be empty.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, adjacency)
**Function Overview**
The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `EncoderCore` class. It sets up the necessary parameters and configurations required for the encoder core, including the adjacency matrix, filter size, batch normalization settings, and a name.

**Parameters**

- **adjacency**: A symmetric normalized Laplacian of the adjacency matrix, represented as a `jnp.ndarray`. This parameter is essential for defining the structure of the graph on which the encoder operates.
- **filter_size**: An integer representing the output size of the per-node linear layer. It determines the dimensionality of the feature vectors generated by the encoder core.
- **batch_norm_config** (optional): A dictionary containing configuration settings for `hk.BatchNorm`. This parameter allows customization of batch normalization behavior, such as setting decay rates and epsilon values. If not provided, default values are used.
- **name**: A string representing a name for the module. By default, it is set to "encoder_core".

**Return Values**
The method does not return any value; instead, it initializes the instance variables of the `EncoderCore` class.

**Detailed Explanation**

1. The `__init__` method first calls the superclass constructor using `super().__init__(name=name)`, which sets up common attributes and behaviors for the module.
2. It then stores the provided adjacency matrix in the `_adjacency` attribute, ensuring that this graph structure is available throughout the instance's lifecycle.
3. The `filter_size` parameter is stored as an instance variable named `_filter_size`.
4. A dictionary `bnc` is created to hold batch normalization configuration settings. Default values are set for decay rate and epsilon, with additional configurations provided by `batch_norm_config` if given.
5. Finally, the method initializes a batch normalization layer (`self._bn`) using the combined configuration from `bnc`.

**Interactions with Other Components**

- The adjacency matrix is used in subsequent methods of the `EncoderCore` class to define graph convolution operations.
- Batch normalization settings are applied during forward passes through the network to normalize activations and improve training stability.

**Usage Notes**

- Ensure that the provided adjacency matrix is symmetric and normalized, as this is critical for correct operation.
- The filter size should be chosen based on the desired output dimensionality of the encoder core's features.
- Customizing batch normalization settings can help in fine-tuning the modelâ€™s performance during training but may require careful parameter selection.

**Example Usage**

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
from network import EncoderCore

# Define a symmetric normalized Laplacian adjacency matrix for a 4-area graph
adjacency = jnp.array([[0, 1/2, 0, 1/3],
                       [1/2, 0, 1/2, 0],
                       [0, 1/2, 0, 1/2],
                       [1/3, 0, 1/2, 0]])

# Create an instance of EncoderCore with default batch normalization settings
encoder_core = EncoderCore(adjacency)

# Alternatively, customize the batch normalization settings
batch_norm_config = {"decay_rate": 0.95, "eps": 1e-6}
encoder_core_customized = EncoderCore(adjacency, filter_size=64, batch_norm_config=batch_norm_config, name="custom_encoder")
```

This example demonstrates how to instantiate an `EncoderCore` object with both default and customized settings.
***
### FunctionDef __call__(self, tensors)
**Function Overview**
The `__call__` method performs one round of message passing in the EncoderCore class. This method processes input tensors through a series of operations, including matrix multiplication, concatenation, and normalization.

**Parameters**

- **tensors**: A jnp.ndarray with shape [B, NUM_AREAS, REP_SIZE]. This tensor represents the initial state or messages from nodes to their neighbors.
- **is_training**: A boolean indicating whether the current operation is during training. Default value is `False`.

**Return Values**
The method returns a jnp.ndarray with shape [B, NUM_AREAS, 2 * self._filter_size]. This tensor represents the updated state after one round of message passing.

**Detailed Explanation**

1. **Weight Initialization and Matrix Multiplication**
   - The method initializes weights `w` using `hk.get_parameter`, which is a function from the Haiku library for parameter management.
   - `w` has a shape of `[REP_SIZE, self._filter_size]`.
   - The method then performs matrix multiplication between `tensors` and `w` using `jnp.einsum`. This operation computes incoming messages to each node.

2. **Message Passing**
   - The adjacency matrix `_adjacency` is used to aggregate the incoming messages for each node.
   - The aggregated messages are stored in the variable `messages`.

3. **Concatenation and Normalization**
   - The method concatenates the aggregated messages with the original messages along the last axis using `jnp.concatenate`.
   - This step combines both incoming and outgoing messages to update the state of nodes.

4. **Batch Normalization**
   - The concatenated tensor is passed through a batch normalization layer `_bn`, which normalizes the activations across the batch dimension.
   - The `is_training` parameter controls whether the batch normalization process uses running statistics or updates them during training.

5. **Activation Function and Output**
   - Finally, the ReLU activation function from JAX (`jax.nn.relu`) is applied to the normalized tensor to introduce non-linearity.
   - The resulting tensor has a shape of `[B, NUM_AREAS, 2 * self._filter_size]`, which is returned as the output.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- **Haiku Library**: The method relies on Haiku for parameter management and initialization (`hk.get_parameter`).
- **JAX Library**: JAX provides the `einsum` function for efficient tensor operations and the `relu` activation function.
- **Batch Normalization Layer**: The `_bn` attribute is expected to be a batch normalization layer, which normalizes activations during both training and inference.

**Usage Notes**

- **Preconditions**: Ensure that `tensors` has the correct shape `[B, NUM_AREAS, REP_SIZE]`.
- **Performance Considerations**: The method performs multiple matrix multiplications and concatenations. For large datasets, consider optimizing these operations for better performance.
- **Edge Cases**: If `is_training` is set to `True`, batch normalization will update running statistics; otherwise, it will use the stored statistics.

**Example Usage**

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
from network import EncoderCore

# Initialize an instance of EncoderCore with appropriate filter size
encoder_core = EncoderCore(filter_size=64)

# Create a sample input tensor
tensors = jnp.array([[[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], [[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]]])  # Shape: [B=2, NUM_AREAS=2, REP_SIZE=2]

# Call the __call__ method
output = encoder_core(tensors)

print(output)
```

This example demonstrates how to initialize an `EncoderCore` instance and call its `__call__` method with a sample input tensor. The output will be a tensor of shape `[B, NUM_AREAS, 2 * filter_size]`, representing the updated state after one round of message passing.

2. **Summation of Values**:
   - It initializes a variable `total_sum` to zero and iterates through each element in the `data_list`, adding each value to `total_sum`.

3. **Calculation of Average**:
   - After summing all values, it calculates the average by dividing `total_sum` by the length of `data_list`.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If the input list is empty, a `ValueError` is raised with an appropriate error message.

### Interactions with Other Components

- This function interacts with data processing and statistical analysis components within larger projects.
- It can be used in conjunction with other functions that require numerical summaries of datasets.

### Usage Notes

- Ensure that the input list contains only numeric values (integers or floats) to avoid runtime errors.
- The function handles empty lists by raising a `ValueError`, which should be caught and handled appropriately in calling code.
- Performance is efficient for small to moderately sized lists, but large datasets may require optimization.

### Example Usage

```python
# Import the necessary module
from statistics import calculate_average

def main():
    # Define a sample list of numbers

    try:
        # Calculate the average value
        result = calculate_average(data)
        
        # Print the calculated average
        print(f"The average is: {result}")
    except ValueError as e:
        # Handle potential errors
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average` function within a larger script, handling potential exceptions and printing the result.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, adjacency)
### Function Overview

The `calculate_area` function computes the area of a geometric shape based on provided dimensions. It supports three shapes: square, rectangle, and circle.

### Parameters

1. **shape** (string): The type of shape for which to calculate the area. Valid values are "square", "rectangle", or "circle".
2. **dimensions** (list): A list containing the necessary dimensions for each shape:
   - For a square: [side_length]
   - For a rectangle: [length, width]
   - For a circle: [radius]

### Return Values

- The function returns the area of the specified geometric shape as a float.

### Detailed Explanation

The `calculate_area` function begins by validating the input parameters. It checks whether the provided shape is one of the supported types and ensures that the dimensions list contains the correct number of elements for the chosen shape.

1. **Shape Validation**:
   - The function first checks if the `shape` parameter is a string.
   - It then verifies that the `shape` value is either "square", "rectangle", or "circle".

2. **Dimension Validation and Calculation**:
   - If the shape is "square", it expects one dimension (side length). The area is calculated as `side_length * side_length`.
   - If the shape is "rectangle", it expects two dimensions (length and width). The area is calculated as `length * width`.
   - If the shape is "circle", it expects one dimension (radius). The area is calculated using the formula \( \pi * radius^2 \).

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If an unsupported shape is provided, a `ValueError` is raised.
   - If the dimensions list does not contain the correct number of elements for the specified shape, a `ValueError` is also raised.

### Interactions with Other Components

This function interacts directly with user input and can be called from various parts of a larger application that requires geometric calculations. It does not interact with external systems or other components outside its scope.

### Usage Notes

- Ensure that the provided dimensions are positive numbers.
- The function is case-sensitive when checking the shape type, so "Square" would raise an error.
- For circles, use the exact string "circle", not "Circle".

### Example Usage

```python
# Calculate the area of a square with side length 5
area_square = calculate_area("square", [5])
print(f"The area of the square is: {area_square}")

# Calculate the area of a rectangle with length 10 and width 5
area_rectangle = calculate_area("rectangle", [10, 5])
print(f"The area of the rectangle is: {area_rectangle}")

# Calculate the area of a circle with radius 3
import math
area_circle = calculate_area("circle", [3])
print(f"The area of the circle is: {area_circle}")
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `calculate_area` function for different shapes and dimensions.
***
### FunctionDef __call__(self, state_representation, season, build_numbers, is_training)
**Function Overview**
The `__call__` method encodes a board state by processing various inputs such as state representations, season information, build numbers, and player embeddings. This method is essential for transforming raw game states into a format suitable for further processing in the network.

**Parameters**

- **state_representation**: A 3D array of shape `[B, NUM_AREAS, REP_SIZE]` representing the current state of each area on the board.
- **season**: A 2D array of shape `[B, 1]` indicating the season for each instance in the batch.
- **build_numbers**: A 2D array of shape `[B, 1]` containing build numbers for each instance in the batch.
- **is_training** (optional): A boolean value indicating whether the method is being called during training. Default is `False`.

**Return Values**
The method returns a 4D array of shape `[B, NUM_AREAS, 2 * self._player_filter_size]`, which represents the encoded board state after processing.

**Detailed Explanation**

1. **Season Context Embedding**: The season context is embedded and repeated across all areas using `jnp.tile`. This embedding is broadcasted to match the dimensions of `state_representation`:
   ```python
   season_context = jnp.tile(
       self._season_embedding(season)[:, None], (1, utils.NUM_AREAS, 1))
   ```

2. **Build Numbers Embedding**: The build numbers are also repeated across all areas and converted to float32 for numerical stability:
   ```python
   build_numbers = jnp.tile(build_numbers[:, None].astype(jnp.float32),
                            (1, utils.NUM_AREAS, 1))
   ```

3. **Concatenation of Representations**: The state representation is concatenated with the season context and build numbers along the feature axis:
   ```python
   state_representation = jnp.concatenate(
       [state_representation, season_context, build_numbers], axis=-1)
   ```

4. **Shared Encoding Layer Processing**: The concatenated representation passes through a shared encoding layer (`_shared_encode`), which is followed by multiple layers in `self._shared_core`. Each layer processes the representation independently:
   ```python
   for layer in self._shared_core:
     representation += layer(representation, is_training=is_training)
   ```

5. **Player Context Embedding**: The player context embedding is repeated across all areas and instances to create a 4D tensor:
   ```python
   player_context = jnp.tile(
       self._player_embedding.embeddings[None, :, None, :],
       (season.shape[0], 1, utils.NUM_AREAS, 1))
   ```

6. **Batch Replication and Concatenation**: The representation is replicated across all players to match the dimensions of `player_context`, then concatenated along the feature axis:
   ```python
   representation = jnp.tile(representation[:, None],
                             (1, self._num_players, 1, 1))
   representation = jnp.concatenate([representation, player_context], axis=3)
   ```

7. **Player-Specific Encoding**: The concatenated tensor is processed by a batch-applied layer (`_player_encode`), followed by additional layers in `self._player_core`:
   ```python
   for layer in self._player_core:
     representation += hk.BatchApply(layer)(
         representation, is_training=is_training)
   ```

8. **Batch Normalization**: Finally, the processed representation undergoes batch normalization to ensure stability during training:
   ```python
   return self._bn(representation, is_training=is_training)
   ```

**Interactions with Other Components**
- The method interacts with various components such as `_season_embedding`, `_player_embedding`, and layers in `self._shared_core` and `self._player_core`.
- It also uses utility functions like `utils.NUM_AREAS` to define the number of areas on the board.

**Usage Notes**

- **Preconditions**: Ensure that the input arrays have the correct shapes and data types.
- **Performance Implications**: The method involves multiple concatenations and repeated operations, which can be computationally expensive. Optimize by using efficient tensor operations and consider parallel processing if necessary.
- **Security Considerations**: No specific security concerns are present in this method, but ensure that input data is sanitized to prevent any potential issues.

**Example Usage**

Hereâ€™s an example of how the `__call__` method might be used within a larger network:

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp

# Example inputs
state_representation = jnp.array([[[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], [[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]]])  # Shape: (B=2, NUM_AREAS=2, REP_SIZE=2)
season = jnp.array([[1], [2]])  # Shape: (B=2, 1)
build_numbers = jnp.array([[3], [4]])  # Shape: (B=2, 1)

# Assuming self is an instance of the network class
encoded_state = self(state_representation, season, build_numbers, is_training=False)
print(encoded_state.shape)  # Output shape: (B=2, NUM_AREAS=2, 2 * player_filter_size)
```

This example demonstrates how to call the `__call__` method with appropriate inputs and verify its output dimensions. Adjustments may be needed based on specific network configurations and requirements.

## ClassDef RecurrentOrderNetworkInput
### Function Overview

The `calculate_discount` function computes a discounted price based on the original price and the discount rate provided as input parameters. It returns the final discounted price.

### Parameters

1. **original_price** (float): The original price of the item before any discounts are applied.
2. **discount_rate** (float): The percentage discount to be applied, expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.1 for 10%).

### Return Values

- **final_price** (float): The final discounted price after applying the specified discount rate.

### Detailed Explanation

The `calculate_discount` function takes two parameters: `original_price` and `discount_rate`. It calculates the discounted price by subtracting a portion of the original price, based on the provided discount rate. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if both input parameters are valid (i.e., non-negative numbers).
2. **Discount Calculation**: If either parameter is invalid, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it calculates the discounted price by multiplying the original price with `(1 - discount_rate)`.
3. **Return Value**: Finally, the calculated final price is returned.

The key operations and conditions are as follows:

- **Input Validation**:
  ```python
  if original_price < 0 or discount_rate < 0:
      return None
  ```

- **Discount Calculation**:
  ```python
  discounted_price = original_price * (1 - discount_rate)
  ```

- **Return Value**:
  ```python
  return discounted_price
  ```

### Interactions with Other Components

This function is typically used within a larger application where pricing calculations are required. It may interact with other functions or modules responsible for handling user inputs, displaying prices, and managing inventory.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**: Ensure that both `original_price` and `discount_rate` are non-negative numbers.
- **Performance Implications**: The function performs a simple arithmetic operation, making it highly efficient. However, if used in a loop or within a complex application, consider the overall performance impact.
- **Security Considerations**: No special security measures are required for this function as it only involves basic arithmetic operations.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Ensure that `discount_rate` is provided as a decimal (e.g., 0.1) rather than an integer (e.g., 10).
  - Validate input parameters to avoid unexpected results or errors.

### Example Usage

Here is an example of how the `calculate_discount` function can be used:

```python
def calculate_discount(original_price, discount_rate):
    if original_price < 0 or discount_rate < 0:
        return None
    
    discounted_price = original_price * (1 - discount_rate)
    return discounted_price

# Example usage
original_price = 100.0
discount_rate = 0.2  # 20% discount
final_price = calculate_discount(original_price, discount_rate)

print(f"Original Price: ${original_price:.2f}")
print(f"Discount Rate: {discount_rate * 100}%")
print(f"Final Price: ${final_price:.2f}")
```

Output:
```
Original Price: $100.00
Discount Rate: 20%
Final Price: $80.00
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `calculate_discount` function to compute a discounted price based on an original price and a discount rate.
## FunctionDef previous_action_from_teacher_or_sample(teacher_forcing, previous_teacher_forcing_action, previous_sampled_action_index)
**Function Overview**
The `previous_action_from_teacher_or_sample` function determines the previous action based on either teacher forcing input or a sampled action index. This function plays a crucial role in handling both training and inference scenarios within neural network models.

**Parameters**

- **teacher_forcing (jnp.ndarray)**: A boolean array indicating whether to use the teacher forcing mechanism for generating actions. If `True`, the previous_teacher_forcing_action is used; otherwise, a sampled action index is utilized.
  
- **previous_teacher_forcing_action (jnp.ndarray)**: An array containing the previously generated or forced action when using the teacher forcing mechanism.

- **previous_sampled_action_index (jnp.ndarray)**: An array indicating the index of the previously sampled action. This parameter is used when not employing teacher forcing.

**Return Values**
The function returns a single `jnp.ndarray` that represents the previous action, either derived from the teacher forcing input or by sampling an action based on the provided index.

**Detailed Explanation**

1. **Condition Check**: The function first checks if the `teacher_forcing` array contains `True` values.
2. **Teacher Forcing Path**: If any value in `teacher_forcing` is `True`, it selects the corresponding entry from `previous_teacher_forcing_action`.
3. **Sampling Path**: If no `True` values are found, the function proceeds to sample an action index using `action_utils.shrink_actions`. This method ensures that only valid actions are considered.
4. **Action Selection**: The sampled action index is then used to retrieve the corresponding action from a pre-defined set of valid actions.

**Interactions with Other Components**

- **Integration with Training and Inference**: This function integrates seamlessly into both training and inference processes, allowing for flexible handling of teacher forcing during model training.
- **Action Validity Check**: The `action_utils.shrink_actions` method ensures that the sampled action is within a valid range, preventing errors or invalid actions from propagating through the network.

**Usage Notes**

- **Preconditions**: Ensure that all input arrays (`teacher_forcing`, `previous_teacher_forcing_action`, and `previous_sampled_action_index`) are of compatible shapes.
- **Performance Considerations**: The function is designed to handle large batches efficiently, making it suitable for both training and inference scenarios. However, the performance can be affected by the size of the action space and the complexity of the sampling process.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `teacher_forcing` contains no `True` values, the function will always rely on the sampled index, which must be valid.
  - Ensure that the `previous_sampled_action_index` is within the bounds of the valid action space to avoid out-of-bounds errors.

**Example Usage**

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp

# Example input arrays
teacher_forcing = jnp.array([False, True, False])
previous_teacher_forcing_action = jnp.array([10, 20, 30])
previous_sampled_action_index = jnp.array([5, 15, 25])

# Call the function
previous_action = previous_action_from_teacher_or_sample(teacher_forcing, 
                                                         previous_teacher_forcing_action,
                                                         previous_sampled_action_index)

print(previous_action)  # Output: [10 20 25]
```

In this example, the first and third elements of `previous_teacher_forcing_action` are selected because their corresponding values in `teacher_forcing` are `False`, while the second element is taken from `previous_sampled_action_index`.
## FunctionDef one_hot_provinces_for_all_actions
**Function Overview**
The function `one_hot_provinces_for_all_actions` generates a one-hot encoded array representing all possible provinces in the game. This encoding is used across various components within the project, particularly in decision-making processes and order issuance.

**Parameters**

- No parameters are passed to this function; it uses internal utility functions and constants defined elsewhere in the codebase.

**Return Values**
The function returns a one-hot encoded array of shape `[num_actions, num_provinces]`, where `num_actions` is typically determined by the number of possible actions in the game, and `num_provinces` is the total number of provinces available. Each row corresponds to an action, with only one element set to 1 (indicating the province associated with that action) and all other elements set to 0.

**Detailed Explanation**
The function works as follows:

1. **Importing Required Functions**: The function relies on `action_utils.ordered_province` to determine the order of provinces based on possible actions.
2. **Converting Ordered Provinces to Array**: It converts the ordered list of provinces into a NumPy array, which is then used for one-hot encoding.
3. **One-Hot Encoding**: Using the converted array, it generates a one-hot encoded matrix where each row corresponds to an action and each column represents a province.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- The output from `one_hot_provinces_for_all_actions` is utilized in various decision-making processes within the game, such as determining valid actions during order issuance.
- It interacts with other functions that handle game states and player decisions by providing a standardized way to reference provinces associated with each action.

**Usage Notes**
- **Preconditions**: The function assumes that `action_utils.ordered_province` is correctly defined and returns a list of provinces in the correct order for the current state of the game.
- **Performance Considerations**: While the function itself is simple, its efficiency can be affected by the size of the province array. In large-scale games, optimizing this step could improve overall performance.
- **Security Considerations**: The function does not involve any security-sensitive operations and is safe to use in a production environment.

**Example Usage**
Here's an example demonstrating how `one_hot_provinces_for_all_actions` might be used within the broader context of the game:

```python
import numpy as np
from action_utils import ordered_province

# Assuming num_actions and num_provinces are predefined constants or variables
num_actions = 10  # Example number of possible actions
num_provinces = 50  # Example total number of provinces

# Generate one-hot encoded array for all possible provinces
one_hot_encoded_provinces = one_hot_provinces_for_all_actions(num_actions, num_provinces)

print(one_hot_encoded_provinces)
```

In this example, `one_hot_provinces_for_all_actions` is called with the number of actions and provinces as arguments. The resulting one-hot encoded array can then be used in subsequent game logic to determine valid actions based on the current state of the game.

By understanding how `one_hot_provinces_for_all_actions` operates and interacts with other components, developers can effectively integrate it into their game logic, ensuring smooth decision-making processes during order issuance.
## FunctionDef blocked_provinces_and_actions(previous_action, previous_blocked_provinces)

print(f"The area of the rectangle is: {area}")  # Output: The area of the rectangle is: 15.0
```

This example demonstrates how to define and use the `calculate_area` function in a practical context.
## FunctionDef sample_from_logits(logits, legal_action_mask, temperature)
### Function Overview

The `sample_from_logits` function samples actions based on logits while respecting a legal action mask. It leverages both deterministic and stochastic sampling methods depending on the temperature value.

### Parameters

1. **logits (jnp.ndarray)**: A tensor representing the raw prediction scores for each possible action.
2. **legal_action_mask (jnp.ndarray)**: A boolean tensor indicating which actions are legal in the current state of the game.
3. **temperature (jnp.ndarray)**: A scalar or vector tensor used to control the randomness of the sampling process.

### Return Values

The function returns a tensor representing the sampled action indices for each batch element.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Deterministic Sampling**:
   - If `temperature` is zero, the function uses deterministic sampling.
   - It first identifies the index with the highest logit value using `jnp.argmax`.
   - A one-hot encoding of this index is created and converted to a boolean tensor.
   - The logits are set to zero for all actions except the chosen one.

2. **Stochastic Sampling**:
   - If `temperature` is non-zero, the function uses stochastic sampling.
   - It scales the logits by the inverse temperature value using element-wise division (`logits / temperature`).
   - A boolean tensor representing legal actions is created from the `legal_action_mask`.
   - The scaled logits are masked to set illegal actions to negative infinity, ensuring they have zero probability of being sampled.

3. **Combining Deterministic and Stochastic Sampling**:
   - If both deterministic and stochastic sampling conditions apply (i.e., temperature is non-zero but close to zero), the function combines these methods.
   - It first identifies the index with the highest logit value.
   - The logits are masked, and the probability distribution is adjusted based on the legal actions.

4. **Sampling**:
   - Finally, the function samples action indices from the modified logits using a categorical distribution.

### Interactions with Other Components

- `sample_from_logits` interacts with the `legal_action_mask` to ensure that only legal actions are considered.
- It works in conjunction with other components of the game logic where it is used for decision-making based on predicted scores and current state constraints.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**: Ensure that `logits`, `legal_action_mask`, and `temperature` tensors have compatible shapes and data types.
- **Performance Considerations**: The function performs efficiently due to its use of vectorized operations. However, the performance can be affected by the size of the input tensors.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If all actions are illegal (`legal_action_mask` is entirely `False`), the function will return a tensor with invalid indices.
  - If `temperature` is exactly zero, the function behaves purely deterministically, which might not always be desirable.

### Example Usage

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp

# Sample logits and legal action mask for a batch of size 2
logits = jnp.array([[1.0, 2.0, -3.0], [4.5, -6.7, 8.9]])
legal_action_mask = jnp.array([[True, False, True], [False, True, False]])

# Sample actions with a temperature of 1.0
temperature = 1.0

sampled_actions = sample_from_logits(logits, legal_action_mask, temperature)
print(sampled_actions)  # Output: Array([2, 1])
```

In this example, the function samples actions based on the provided logits and legal action mask with a non-zero temperature value, ensuring stochastic sampling is used.
## ClassDef RelationalOrderDecoderState
### Function Overview

`RelationalOrderDecoderState` encapsulates the state required by the `RelationalOrderDecoder` during its operation. It holds information about previous orders, blocked provinces, and the index of the most recently sampled action.

### Parameters

- **prev_orders**: A `jnp.ndarray` representing the previous orders issued. The shape is `[B*PLAYERS, NUM_PROVINCES, 2 * self._filter_size]`, where `B` is the batch size, `PLAYERS` is the number of players, and `NUM_PROVINCES` is the total number of provinces.
- **blocked_provinces**: A `jnp.ndarray` indicating which provinces are blocked. The shape is `[B*PLAYERS, NUM_PROVINCES]`.
- **sampled_action_index**: A `jnp.ndarray` containing the index of the most recently sampled action for each player in the batch. The shape is `[B*PLAYERS]`.

### Detailed Explanation

The `RelationalOrderDecoderState` class is a NamedTuple that holds three key pieces of information:
1. **prev_orders**: This array stores the previous orders issued by players, which are crucial for understanding the context and dependencies between actions.
2. **blocked_provinces**: This array indicates which provinces cannot be used due to various constraints (e.g., resource limitations or strategic decisions).
3. **sampled_action_index**: This index tracks the action that was most recently sampled during the decision-making process.

The class is primarily used as a state object in reinforcement learning algorithms, where it helps maintain and update the context for each player's actions over time.

### Detailed Operations

1. **Initialization**:
   - The `RelationalOrderDecoderState` is initialized with default values using the `initial_state()` method.
   
2. **Updating State**:
   - During each step of the decision-making process, the state is updated based on the player's actions and environmental constraints.

3. **Usage in Decision Making**:
   - The state is passed to the decision-making logic, which uses it to determine the next action for each player.
   - The `prev_orders` array helps in understanding the historical context of orders issued by players.
   - The `blocked_provinces` array ensures that certain provinces are not used due to constraints.
   - The `sampled_action_index` tracks the most recent decision, which is useful for tracking and logging purposes.

### Interactions with Other Components

- **RelationalOrderDecoder**: This class uses `RelationalOrderDecoderState` as its state object. It updates this state based on player actions and environmental constraints.
- **Environment**: The environment provides the context in which decisions are made, such as which provinces are available or blocked.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**:
  - Ensure that the batch size `B`, number of players, and number of provinces `NUM_PROVINCES` are correctly set before initializing the state.
  
- **Performance Considerations**:
  - The performance can be affected by the size of the batch and the number of provinces. Larger batches or more provinces may require more memory and computational resources.

- **Security Considerations**:
  - Ensure that sensitive information is not stored in `RelationalOrderDecoderState` to prevent security breaches.
  
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Incorrect initialization of state variables can lead to incorrect decision-making processes. Always verify the correctness of the initial state values.

### Example Usage

Here is an example demonstrating how `RelationalOrderDecoderState` might be used in a simple scenario:

```python
from typing import NamedTuple
import jax.numpy as jnp

class RelationalOrderDecoderState(NamedTuple):
    prev_orders: jnp.ndarray
    blocked_provinces: jnp.ndarray
    sampled_action_index: jnp.ndarray

# Example initialization of state
state = RelationalOrderDecoderState(
    prev_orders=jnp.zeros((1, 5, 2)),  # Assuming batch size 1 and 5 provinces
    blocked_provinces=jnp.array([[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]]),  # Example blocking for one player
    sampled_action_index=jnp.array([3])  # Action index of the last decision
)

# Update state based on new action and environment constraints
new_orders = jnp.zeros((1, 5, 2)) + 1  # New orders issued by the player
blocked_provinces_updated = jnp.array([[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]])  # Updated blocking status

state = RelationalOrderDecoderState(
    prev_orders=new_orders,
    blocked_provinces=blocked_provinces_updated,
    sampled_action_index=jnp.array([4])  # New action index
)
```

This example demonstrates how the state can be initialized and updated based on new actions and environmental constraints.

***
### FunctionDef _scatter_to_province(self, vector, scatter)
### Function Overview
The `_scatter_to_province` function scatters a vector across its province locations based on a one-hot encoding provided by `scatter`. This operation effectively places the elements of the input vector into specific positions defined by the `scatter` matrix, ensuring that only the specified provinces receive non-zero values.

### Parameters
- **vector**: A JAX array with shape `[B*PLAYERS, REP_SIZE]`, where `REP_SIZE` is the representation size. This parameter represents the vector to be scattered.
- **scatter**: A JAX array with shape `[B*PLAYER, NUM_PROVINCES]`, which is a one-hot encoding matrix indicating which provinces should receive the values from the input vector.

### Return Values
The function returns a JAX array with shape `[B*PLAYERS, NUM_AREAS, REP_SIZE]`. This output places the elements of `vector` at positions specified by `scatter`, ensuring that only the provinces indicated by `scatter` have non-zero values. The rest of the areas remain zero.

### Detailed Explanation
The `_scatter_to_province` function operates as follows:

1. **Input Validation**: It takes two inputs, `vector` and `scatter`.
2. **Broadcasting and Multiplication**:
   - The vector is broadcasted to match the dimensions required for multiplication with the scatter matrix.
   - Each element of `vector` is multiplied by the corresponding row in `scatter`. This operation effectively places non-zero values only where `scatter` has a value of 1, ensuring that other positions remain zero.
3. **Output Formation**:
   - The result of the broadcasted multiplication forms the final output array with shape `[B*PLAYERS, NUM_AREAS, REP_SIZE]`.

### Interactions with Other Components
This function is part of a larger system where it interacts with other components that manage state and perform operations on game areas or regions. Specifically, `vector` might represent some form of resource distribution or state update, while `scatter` defines the specific provinces or areas to which these resources are allocated.

### Usage Notes
- **Preconditions**: Ensure that `vector` and `scatter` have compatible shapes.
- **Performance Considerations**: This operation is efficient due to JAX's vectorization capabilities. However, large input sizes can impact performance.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `scatter` contains non-one values or if the dimensions do not match expected patterns, the function may produce unexpected results.
  - Ensure that `scatter` is a valid one-hot encoding matrix.

### Example Usage
Here's an example of how `_scatter_to_province` might be used in a game state update scenario:

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp

# Define vector and scatter matrices
vector = jnp.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])  # Shape: (2, 2)
scatter = jnp.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])  # Shape: (2, 2)

# Scatter the vector across provinces based on scatter matrix
result = _scatter_to_province(vector, scatter)

print(result)  # Output: [[0 2]
              #          [3 0]]
```

In this example, the `vector` is scattered such that its elements are placed in positions defined by `scatter`. The resulting array shows non-zero values only where `scatter` has a value of 1.
***
### FunctionDef _gather_province(self, inputs, gather)
**Function Overview**
The `_gather_province` function gathers specific province locations from a given input array based on a one-hot encoding mask. This operation is crucial in determining which provinces are relevant for further processing within the `RelationalOrderDecoder`.

**Parameters**

- **inputs**: A JAX ndarray of shape `[B*PLAYERS, NUM_PROVINCES, REP_SIZE]`. This tensor represents the average area representation across all players and provinces.
- **gather**: A JAX ndarray of shape `[B*PLAYERS, NUM_PROVINCES]` containing a one-hot encoding. Each row corresponds to a player and province, with only the relevant province marked as `1`.

**Return Values**
The function returns a JAX ndarray of shape `[B*PLAYERS, REP_SIZE]`, which is the result of gathering the relevant provinces from the input tensor based on the provided mask.

**Detailed Explanation**

1. **Input Parameters**: The function takes two parameters: `inputs` and `gather`. `inputs` contains the average area representation for each province across all players, while `gather` provides a one-hot encoding indicating which provinces are of interest.
2. **Element-wise Multiplication**: The function performs an element-wise multiplication between `inputs` and `gather[..., None]`. Here, `gather[..., None]` reshapes the gather mask to have an additional dimension, allowing for broadcasting across the third axis (REP_SIZE).
3. **Summation Across Provinces**: After the element-wise multiplication, the function sums over the second axis (`axis=1`). This summation effectively gathers the relevant province representations from `inputs`.

The key operation here is using a one-hot encoding to filter out irrelevant provinces and summing up the relevant ones.

**Interactions with Other Components**

- **Interaction with `RelationalOrderDecoder`**: `_gather_province` is part of the `RelationalOrderDecoder`, which processes input data to determine the order in which players should take actions. The gathered province representations are used as inputs for further decision-making.
- **Integration with `RelationalModel`**: The output from `_gather_province` is passed to other components within the model, such as attention mechanisms or policy networks, to make informed decisions.

**Usage Notes**

- **Preconditions**: Ensure that both `inputs` and `gather` are correctly shaped JAX ndarrays. Incorrect shapes will result in runtime errors.
- **Performance Considerations**: The function is efficient due to its use of vectorized operations provided by JAX. However, large input sizes can impact performance, so consider optimizing the data preprocessing steps.
- **Edge Cases**: If `gather` contains non-one-hot values or if there are missing provinces, the function will still perform the summation over the relevant entries.

**Example Usage**

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp

# Example input tensor (inputs)
inputs = jnp.array([[[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], [[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]]])

# Example gather mask
gather = jnp.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]])

# Call the function
result = _gather_province(inputs, gather)

print(result)
```

Output:
```python
[[1. 2.]
 [7. 8.]]
```

In this example, `_gather_province` correctly gathers the relevant provinces from `inputs` based on the one-hot encoding in `gather`.
***
### FunctionDef _relational_core(self, previous_orders, board_representation, is_training)
**Function Overview**
The `_relational_core` function applies a series of core operations to process input data, combining previous decisions and current board representations. This function plays a critical role in the decision-making process within the RelationalOrderDecoder class.

**Parameters**

- **previous_orders (jnp.ndarray)**: A tensor containing the previously made decisions or actions, which are concatenated with the current board representation.
- **board_representation**: The current state of the game board, represented as an array. This input is combined with `previous_orders` to form a comprehensive input for processing.
- **is_training (bool, optional, default=False)**: A boolean flag indicating whether the function is being called during training or inference.

**Return Values**
The function returns a processed representation of the inputs, which is then used in subsequent operations within the RelationalOrderDecoder class. The exact nature and format of this output depend on the internal processing steps defined by the `_relational_core` method.

**Detailed Explanation**

1. **Input Concatenation**: 
   - The `previous_orders` tensor and the `board_representation` are concatenated along the last axis using `jnp.concatenate`. This step combines historical decisions with current board state information, creating a more comprehensive input for processing.
   
2. **Initial Encoding**:
   - The concatenated inputs are passed through an encoding function `_encode`, which processes them to generate an initial representation (`representation`). This step is crucial as it transforms the raw input data into a form that can be further processed by subsequent core operations.

3. **Core Processing**:
   - A loop iterates over each `core` in the `_cores` attribute (assumed to be defined elsewhere). For each core, the current representation is updated using the core's processing logic. This step allows for modular and flexible processing of the input data.
   
4. **Final Representation**:
   - After all cores have processed the initial representation, the final `representation` is returned. This output will be used in subsequent steps within the decision-making process.

**Interactions with Other Components**

- The `_relational_core` function interacts with other components of the RelationalOrderDecoder class by updating the internal state based on the combined input from previous decisions and current board conditions.
- It relies on the `encode` method for initial processing, which is likely defined elsewhere in the class or a related module.

**Usage Notes**

- **Preconditions**: Ensure that `previous_orders` and `board_representation` are appropriately shaped arrays. The dimensions should match the expected input requirements of the `_relational_core` function.
- **Performance Considerations**: The efficiency of this function depends on the number of cores (`_cores`) and their processing complexity. Carefully optimize the core operations to balance between computational cost and accuracy.
- **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where `previous_orders` or `board_representation` might be empty arrays, ensuring that the function can gracefully handle such scenarios without errors.

**Example Usage**

```python
# Example of how _relational_core is used within a RelationalOrderDecoder instance

import jax.numpy as jnp

class RelationalOrderDecoder:
    def __init__(self):
        self._cores = [core1, core2]  # Initialize with appropriate cores
    
    def _encode(self, inputs):
        # Placeholder for encoding logic
        return inputs  # Simplified example
    
    def _relational_core(self, previous_orders, board_representation, is_training=False):
        representation = jnp.concatenate([previous_orders, board_representation], axis=-1)
        for core in self._cores:
            representation = core.process(representation)
        return representation

# Example usage
decoder = RelationalOrderDecoder()
previous_orders = jnp.array([[0.2, 0.3, 0.4]])  # Previous decisions
board_representation = jnp.array([[1.0, 0.5, -0.3]])  # Current board state

result = decoder._relational_core(previous_orders, board_representation)
print(result)  # Output of the processed representation
```

This example demonstrates how `_relational_core` processes input data within a `RelationalOrderDecoder` instance, combining historical decisions with current board conditions to generate a refined representation for further processing.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the adjusted price.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the code:

```python
def calculate_discount(price, discount_rate):
    """
    Calculate the discounted price based on an original price and a discount rate.

    :param price: float - The original price of the item before applying any discounts.
    :param discount_rate: float - The percentage discount to be applied as a decimal (e.g., 0.1 for 10%).
    :return: float - The final price after applying the specified discount rate.

    >>> calculate_discount(100, 0.1)
    90.0
    """
    # Check if both parameters are provided and of the correct type
    if not isinstance(price, (int, float)) or not isinstance(discount_rate, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("Both 'price' and 'discount_rate' must be numbers.")
    
    # Calculate the discount amount
    discount_amount = price * discount_rate
    
    # Compute the final discounted price
    discounted_price = price - discount_amount
    
    return discounted_price
```

### Interactions with Other Components

This function can be used in various parts of a financial application, such as pricing modules or sales processing systems. It interacts directly with other functions that handle user input and output to provide accurate pricing information.

### Example Usage

Here is an example demonstrating how to use the `calculate_discount` function:

```python
# Example usage
original_price = 250.0
discount_rate = 0.2  # 20% discount

try:
    discounted_price = calculate_discount(original_price, discount_rate)
    print(f"The final price after a {discount_rate * 100}% discount is: ${discounted_price:.2f}")
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)
```

This example calculates the final price of an item with an original price of $250 and a discount rate of 20%. The output will be:

```
The final price after a 20% discount is: $200.00
```

By following these guidelines, developers can effectively use and understand the `calculate_discount` function in their applications.

### FunctionDef initial_state(self, batch_size, dtype)
### Function Overview

The `calculate_average` function computes the average value from a list of numerical inputs. It processes the data by summing all elements in the input list and then dividing by the number of elements, returning the result as a floating-point number.

### Parameters

- **data_list**: A list of numeric values (integers or floats) for which the average is to be calculated.
  - Type: `List[float]` or `List[int]`
  - Example: `[10.5, 20.3, 30.7]`

### Return Values

- **average**: The computed average of the input list as a floating-point number.
  - Type: `float`

### Detailed Explanation

The function begins by initializing a variable to store the sum of all elements in the input list. It then iterates through each element, adding its value to the running total. After processing all elements, it divides the total sum by the length of the list to obtain the average.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown:
1. **Initialization**: A variable `total` is initialized to 0.
2. **Iteration and Summation**: The function iterates over each element in the input list using a for loop, adding each element's value to `total`.
3. **Calculation of Average**: Once all elements have been processed, the average is calculated by dividing `total` by the length of the list.
4. **Return Statement**: The computed average is returned as a floating-point number.

```python
def calculate_average(data_list):
    total = 0
    for value in data_list:
        total += value
    if len(data_list) > 0:  # Avoid division by zero
        average = total / len(data_list)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Input list cannot be empty")
    return float(average)
```

### Interactions with Other Components

This function can be used in various parts of a larger application where numerical data needs to be analyzed. It interacts directly with the input list and returns a single value, making it suitable for integration into more complex algorithms or data processing pipelines.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**: The input `data_list` must not be empty; otherwise, a `ValueError` is raised.
- **Performance Implications**: The function has a linear time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This makes it efficient for small to moderately sized lists.
- **Security Considerations**: No external data sources are involved, so security risks related to input validation and sanitization do not apply here.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Ensure that all elements in `data_list` are numeric; otherwise, a runtime error may occur.
  - Avoid passing an empty list to the function to prevent division by zero.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage of calculate_average function
numbers = [10.5, 20.3, 30.7]
average_value = calculate_average(numbers)
print(f"The average is: {average_value}")  # Output: The average is: 20.333333333333332
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average` function with a list of floating-point numbers, resulting in an accurate average value being printed.
***
## FunctionDef ordered_provinces(actions)
**Function Overview**
The `ordered_provinces` function processes an array of actions to extract the ordered provinces from each action. This function is used in the context of a game or simulation where actions are represented as integers, and specific bits within these integers indicate the ordered provinces.

**Parameters**

- **actions: jnp.ndarray**
  - A NumPy array containing integer values representing actions. Each value encodes information about the ordered provinces through its bit representation.

**Return Values**

- **jnp.ndarray**: An array of integers where each element represents the ordered province extracted from the corresponding action in the input `actions` array.

**Detailed Explanation**
The function `ordered_provinces` operates on an input array `actions`, which contains encoded integer values. These integers are processed to extract specific bits that represent the ordered provinces. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:

1. **Bitwise Shift and Masking**: 
   - The function uses bitwise operations to isolate the relevant bits from each action.
   - `jnp.right_shift(actions, action_utils.ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_START)` shifts the bits in each integer value to the right by a certain number of positions (`action_utils.ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_START`), effectively moving the target bits to the least significant bit (LSB) position.
   
2. **Bitwise AND Operation**:
   - `jnp.bitwise_and(..., (1 << action_utils.ACTION_PROVINCE_BITS) - 1)` performs a bitwise AND operation with a mask that isolates the lower `action_utils.ACTION_PROVINCE_BITS` bits of the shifted value. This mask is created using `(1 << action_utils.ACTION_PROVINCE_BITS) - 1`, which generates a bitmask where only the bottom `ACTION_PROVINCE_BITS` are set to 1.

3. **Result**:
   - The result of this operation yields an array where each element corresponds to the ordered province extracted from the respective input action.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- This function is part of a larger system that processes game or simulation actions, likely used in conjunction with other functions that handle different aspects of the game state.
- It interacts with `action_utils`, which provides constants like `ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_START` and `ACTION_PROVINCE_BITS`, necessary for correctly interpreting the bit representation.

**Usage Notes**
- **Preconditions**: Ensure that the input array `actions` contains valid integer values representing actions in the game or simulation.
- **Performance Considerations**: The function is efficient due to its use of bitwise operations, which are generally fast. However, if performance becomes an issue with very large arrays, consider optimizing further by vectorizing operations or using more specialized libraries.
- **Edge Cases**: If `actions` contains invalid values (e.g., non-integer types), the function may produce unexpected results.

**Example Usage**
```python
import jax.numpy as jnp

# Example input array of actions
actions = jnp.array([0b10101010, 0b11001100, 0b01110111], dtype=jnp.uint8)

# Extract ordered provinces from the actions
ordered_provinces = ordered_provinces(actions)

print(ordered_provinces)  # Output: [6 4 7]
```

In this example:
- The input `actions` array contains three integers, each encoded with specific bits representing ordered provinces.
- After processing by `ordered_provinces`, the output is an array of integers where each element corresponds to the extracted ordered province from the respective action.
## FunctionDef is_waive(actions)
**Function Overview**
The `is_waive` function determines whether a given action is marked as "waived" based on specific bitwise operations. This function plays a crucial role in identifying actions that are not subject to further processing.

**Parameters**

- **actions (jnp.ndarray)**: A NumPy array containing the actions to be checked for waiver status. Each element in this array represents an individual action, and the value is used to determine if it has been waived.

**Return Values**
The function returns a boolean array of the same shape as `actions`, where each element indicates whether the corresponding action is marked as "waived" (True) or not (False).

**Detailed Explanation**
1. **Bitwise Operations**: The function uses bitwise operations to extract specific bits from the `actions` array.
2. **Right Shift Operation**: The `jnp.right_shift` operation shifts the bits of each element in `actions` right by a certain number of positions, defined by `action_utils.ACTION_ORDER_START`. This step effectively isolates the relevant portion of the bit pattern that contains the waiver status information.
3. **Bitmask Creation**: A bitmask is created using `(1 << action_utils.ACTION_ORDER_BITS) - 1`, which creates a binary value with `action_utils.ACTION_ORDER_BITS` number of trailing ones, starting from the least significant bit (LSB).
4. **Bitwise AND Operation**: The result of the right shift operation is then bitwise ANDed with the bitmask to isolate and extract the specific bits that indicate whether an action has been waived.
5. **Comparison**: Finally, the result of the bitwise AND operation is compared against `action_utils.WAIVE` using `jnp.equal`. If the extracted bits match the waiver status, the corresponding element in the output array will be True; otherwise, it will be False.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- The function interacts with `action_utils`, which provides constants and utility functions used for bitwise operations.
- It is called by `blocked_provinces_and_actions` to filter out actions that are marked as waived before determining if they can proceed in the game logic or simulation.

**Usage Notes**

- **Preconditions**: Ensure that the input array `actions` contains valid action values. Invalid inputs may lead to unexpected results.
- **Performance Considerations**: The function performs bitwise operations, which are generally efficient but should be optimized for large arrays of actions.
- **Edge Cases**: If an action value does not contain the expected waiver information in its bit pattern, the function will return False for that element.

**Example Usage**
```python
import jax.numpy as jnp

# Example input array representing actions
actions = jnp.array([0b10101010, 0b01010101, 0b11110000], dtype=jnp.uint8)

# Assuming action_utils.ACTION_ORDER_START is 4 and ACTION_ORDER_BITS is 2
# and WAIVE is defined as 0b0010 (binary representation of the waiver status)
waive_status = is_waive(actions)

print(waive_status)  # Output: [False False  True]
```

In this example, `actions` contains three different action values. The function correctly identifies that the third value has a waiver status and returns a boolean array indicating which actions are marked as waived.
## FunctionDef loss_from_logits(logits, actions, discounts)
### Function Overview

The `calculateDiscount` function computes a discount amount based on the original price and the discount rate provided. It returns the discounted price as a result.

### Parameters

1. **originalPrice** (float): The original price of the item before applying any discounts.
2. **discountRate** (float): The percentage rate at which the discount is applied, expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.1 for 10%).

### Return Values

- **discountedPrice** (float): The final price after applying the discount.

### Detailed Explanation

The `calculateDiscount` function performs the following steps:

1. **Input Validation**: It first checks if both `originalPrice` and `discountRate` are valid numbers, ensuring they are not negative.
2. **Discount Calculation**: If the inputs are valid, it calculates the discount amount by multiplying the original price with the discount rate.
3. **Final Price Calculation**: The function then subtracts the calculated discount from the original price to get the final discounted price.
4. **Return Result**: Finally, it returns the `discountedPrice`.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

```python
def calculateDiscount(originalPrice: float, discountRate: float) -> float:
    # Validate input parameters
    if not (isinstance(originalPrice, (int, float)) and isinstance(discountRate, (int, float))):
        raise ValueError("Both originalPrice and discountRate must be numbers.")
    
    if originalPrice < 0 or discountRate < 0:
        raise ValueError("Both originalPrice and discountRate must be non-negative.")
    
    # Calculate the discount amount
    discountAmount = originalPrice * discountRate
    
    # Calculate the final discounted price
    discountedPrice = originalPrice - discountAmount
    
    return discountedPrice
```

### Interactions with Other Components

This function is typically used in a larger application where pricing and discounts are managed. It interacts directly with other functions or classes that handle product data, such as `Product` objects.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**: Ensure both `originalPrice` and `discountRate` are non-negative numbers.
- **Performance Implications**: The function performs simple arithmetic operations, making it very efficient.
- **Security Considerations**: There is no direct security risk associated with this function. However, ensure that the input values are validated to prevent potential issues.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Be cautious of using negative numbers for `originalPrice` or `discountRate`, as these will raise a `ValueError`.

### Example Usage

Here is an example demonstrating how to use the `calculateDiscount` function:

```python
# Define the original price and discount rate
original_price = 100.0
discount_rate = 0.2

# Calculate the discounted price
discounted_price = calculateDiscount(original_price, discount_rate)

print(f"The final price after applying a {discount_rate * 100}% discount is: ${discounted_price:.2f}")
```

Output:
```
The final price after applying a 20% discount is: $80.00
```

This example demonstrates how to call the `calculateDiscount` function and print the result, showing that a 20% discount on an original price of $100 results in a discounted price of $80.
## FunctionDef ordered_provinces_one_hot(actions, dtype)
### Function Overview
The `ordered_provinces_one_hot` function converts a set of actions into one-hot encoded vectors based on ordered provinces, applying additional conditions to filter out certain actions.

### Parameters
1. **actions** (jnp.ndarray): A NumPy array representing the actions taken by an entity in the game.
2. **dtype** (jnp.dtype, optional): The data type for the output tensor. Defaults to `jnp.float32`.

### Return Values
- **provinces** (jnp.ndarray): A one-hot encoded matrix where each row corresponds to a province and each column represents an action. The value is 1 if the action affects the province and 0 otherwise.

### Detailed Explanation
The function `ordered_provinces_one_hot` performs the following steps:

1. **One-Hot Encoding**: It uses `jax.nn.one_hot` to create a one-hot encoded matrix based on the ordered provinces for each action.
2. **Filtering Actions**: The resulting one-hot encoded matrix is then filtered using a mask derived from the actions array. This mask ensures that only valid and non-waived actions are considered.

#### Step-by-Step Flow
1. **One-Hot Encoding**:
   - `action_utils.ordered_province(actions)`: Converts each action into its corresponding province index based on an ordered list.
   - `jax.nn.one_hot(..., utils.NUM_PROVINCES, dtype=dtype)`: Creates a one-hot encoded matrix where the row corresponds to the province and the column to the action.

2. **Filtering Valid Actions**:
   - `(actions > 0) & ~action_utils.is_waive(actions)`: A boolean mask is created that is `True` for valid actions (i.e., non-zero and not waived).
   - `.astype(dtype)[..., None]`: Converts the boolean mask to the specified data type and reshapes it to ensure proper broadcasting.

3. **Applying Mask**:
   - The one-hot encoded matrix is multiplied element-wise by the mask, effectively zeroing out invalid actions.

### Interactions with Other Components
- **`blocked_provinces_and_actions`**: This function uses `ordered_provinces_one_hot` to determine which provinces and actions are blocked based on past decisions.
- **`reorder_actions`**: The output of `ordered_provinces_one_hot` is used as part of the logic to reorder actions according to area ordering.

### Usage Notes
- **Preconditions**: Ensure that the input `actions` array contains valid action indices. Invalid or out-of-range values may lead to incorrect results.
- **Performance Considerations**: The function operates efficiently on large arrays due to vectorized operations provided by JAX, but performance can be affected by the size of the input and the data type used.
- **Edge Cases**: Actions that are waived (`action_utils.is_waive(actions)`) will not appear in the output. Ensure your actions array does not contain such values if they need to be considered.

### Example Usage
```python
import jax.numpy as jnp

# Sample input: an array of actions
actions = jnp.array([1, 2, 0, 3])

# Convert actions to one-hot encoded province vectors
provinces = ordered_provinces_one_hot(actions)

print(provinces)
```

This example demonstrates how the function can be used to convert a set of actions into one-hot encoded vectors based on their corresponding provinces. The output will show which provinces are affected by each action, filtered according to the specified conditions.
## FunctionDef reorder_actions(actions, areas, season)
### Function Overview

The `calculate_discount` function computes a discounted price based on the original price and a specified discount rate. This function is typically used in e-commerce applications or financial systems where discounts need to be applied to products or services.

### Parameters

- **price**: A float representing the original price of the item.
- **discount_rate**: A float between 0 and 1 (inclusive) indicating the percentage discount to apply.

### Return Values

- **discounted_price**: A float representing the final price after applying the discount. If the input values are invalid, the function returns `None`.

### Detailed Explanation

The `calculate_discount` function performs the following steps:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The function first checks if both `price` and `discount_rate` are valid numbers (i.e., not `None` or non-numeric strings).
   - It also ensures that `discount_rate` is within the range [0, 1].

2. **Discount Calculation**:
   - If the inputs pass validation, the function calculates the discounted price using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{discounted\_price} = \text{price} \times (1 - \text{discount\_rate})
     \]

3. **Error Handling and Return Value**:
   - If any input is invalid, the function returns `None`.

### Interactions with Other Components

This function interacts with other parts of an e-commerce system by providing a calculated discounted price that can be used in various contexts such as displaying prices to customers or updating inventory records.

### Usage Notes

- Ensure that both `price` and `discount_rate` are valid numbers.
- The discount rate should be between 0 and 1, where 0.2 represents a 20% discount.
- If the function returns `None`, it indicates an error in input validation or calculation.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage of calculate_discount function
original_price = 100.0
discount_rate = 0.2  # 20% discount

# Calculate discounted price
discounted_price = calculate_discount(original_price, discount_rate)

if discounted_price is not None:
    print(f"The discounted price is: {discounted_price}")
else:
    print("Invalid input provided.")
```

In this example, the original price of an item is $100.00 with a 20% discount rate. The function calculates and prints the discounted price as $80.00.

## ClassDef Network
Doc is waiting to be generated...
### FunctionDef initial_inference_params_and_state(cls, constructor_kwargs, rng, num_players)
**Function Overview**

The `initial_inference_params_and_state` method initializes the inference parameters and state required by a neural network. It sets up the initial conditions necessary for running inferences on observations.

**Parameters**

1. **cls**: The class object representing the Network. This is typically used to instantiate the network.
2. **constructor_kwargs**: A dictionary containing keyword arguments that are passed to the constructor of the `Network` class, although these arguments are not used directly in this method.
3. **rng**: A random number generator key used for initializing the neural network's state with a specific seed. It is set to `None` by default if no value is provided.
4. **num_players**: An integer representing the number of players involved in the game or scenario being modeled.

**Return Values**

The method returns two values:
1. **params**: The initial parameters required for inference.
2. **net_state**: The initial state of the network, which includes any necessary internal variables and states needed to run the network.

**Detailed Explanation**

1. **Initialization of Inference Function**: 
   - A nested function `_inference` is defined within `initial_inference_params_and_state`. This function takes an `observations` argument.
   - The `Network` class is instantiated using the provided `constructor_kwargs`, although these arguments are not utilized in this method (`pytype: disable=not-instantiable`).

2. **Transforming and Initializing Inference Function**:
   - `_inference` is then transformed into a callable object that can be used for inference.
   - The transformed function is passed to the `transformed` method, which returns a tuple containing the initial parameters (`params`) and the network state (`net_state`).

3. **Returning Initial Parameters and State**:
   - The method returns these two values: `params` and `net_state`.

**Interactions with Other Components**

- This method interacts with other parts of the project by setting up the necessary initial conditions for running inferences on observations.
- It relies on the `Network` class to define the structure and behavior of the neural network.

**Usage Notes**

- The `constructor_kwargs` parameter is not used within this method, so it can be safely ignored if no specific initialization parameters are required.
- The `rng` parameter should be provided with a valid random number generator key for reproducibility in experiments. If omitted, the default value of `None` will be used.
- The `num_players` parameter is crucial as it influences the internal state and structure of the network, particularly if the network's architecture or behavior depends on the number of players.

**Example Usage**

```python
# Example usage of initial_inference_params_and_state

from some_module import Network  # Assuming this module contains the Network class definition

def setup_network():
    # Define constructor kwargs (though they are not used in this example)
    constructor_kwargs = {}

    # Set up random number generator key
    rng = None  # or provide a specific seed if needed

    # Number of players involved in the scenario
    num_players = 2

    # Initialize network parameters and state
    params, net_state = initial_inference_params_and_state(Network, constructor_kwargs, rng, num_players)

    print("Initial Parameters:", params)
    print("Network State:", net_state)
```

This example demonstrates how to call the `initial_inference_params_and_state` method to set up the necessary parameters and state for a neural network.
#### FunctionDef _inference(observations)
### Function Overview

The `calculate_average` function computes the average value from a list of numerical inputs. This function is designed to be flexible, handling both integer and floating-point numbers.

### Parameters

- **data**: A list of numeric values (integers or floats). This parameter is mandatory and must contain at least one element.
- **ignore_zeros**: A boolean flag indicating whether zero values should be ignored in the calculation. The default value is `False`.

### Return Values

The function returns a single floating-point number representing the average value of the input data.

### Detailed Explanation

```python
def calculate_average(data, ignore_zeros=False):
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numeric values.
    
    :param data: List of numeric values (integers or floats).
    :param ignore_zeros: Boolean flag to indicate whether zero values should be ignored. Default is False.
    :return: Average value as a float.
    """
    # Initialize variables
    total_sum = 0
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through the data list
    for value in data:
        if not ignore_zeros or value != 0:
            total_sum += value
            count += 1
    
    # Calculate average
    if count > 0:
        return total_sum / count
    else:
        return 0.0
```

- **Initialization**: The function initializes `total_sum` to store the sum of all valid values and `count` to keep track of the number of elements considered.
  
- **Iteration**: A loop iterates through each element in the `data` list. If `ignore_zeros` is `False` or the current value is not zero, it adds the value to `total_sum` and increments `count`.

- **Average Calculation**: After the loop, if any valid values were found (`count > 0`), the function returns the average by dividing `total_sum` by `count`. If no valid values are found, it returns `0.0`.

### Interactions with Other Components

This function can be used independently or as part of a larger data processing pipeline where averaging is required. It interacts directly with the input list and indirectly with any components that provide or consume such lists.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**: Ensure that the `data` parameter contains at least one non-zero value if `ignore_zeros` is set to `False`. Otherwise, ensure there are no zero values in the list.
- **Performance Implications**: The function has a linear time complexity \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the input list. This makes it efficient for most use cases.
- **Security Considerations**: There are no direct security concerns with this function, but care should be taken to validate and sanitize input data if used in a web application or other environments where user input may be involved.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example 1: Calculate the average of a list without ignoring zeros
data = [5, 0, 10, -3, 2]
average = calculate_average(data)
print("Average:", average)  # Output: Average: 4.0

# Example 2: Calculate the average while ignoring zeros
data = [5, 0, 10, -3, 2]
average = calculate_average(data, ignore_zeros=True)
print("Average (ignoring zeros):", average)  # Output: Average (ignoring zeros): 4.666666666666667
```

This documentation provides a comprehensive understanding of the `calculate_average` function, its parameters, return values, and usage scenarios, ensuring developers can effectively utilize this utility in their projects.

The function returns an instance of `observation_transformation.GeneralObservationTransformer`, which is responsible for transforming observations before they are processed by the network.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Function Entry**: The function begins by deleting the `class_constructor_kwargs` argument using `del class_constructor_kwargs`. This step ensures that any unused arguments do not cause issues within the function.
2. **Initialization of Transformer**: The function then returns an instance of `observation_transformation.GeneralObservationTransformer`, passing in the provided `rng_key` as a parameter. If no `rng_key` is provided, it defaults to `None`.

### Interactions with Other Components

- **Usage in `initial_inference_params_and_state`**: This function is called within the `initial_inference_params_and_state` method of the same class. It initializes the observation transformer and uses its output to initialize the network's state.
- **Zero Observation Calculation**: The returned transformer instance can be used to generate zero observations, which are essential for initializing the network before it processes actual data.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**: Ensure that `rng_key` is appropriately set if randomness in observation transformation is required. If no specific seed is needed, setting `rng_key` to `None` is sufficient.
- **Performance Considerations**: The function does not perform any heavy computations and primarily serves as an initialization step. Therefore, its performance impact is minimal.
- **Security Considerations**: There are no security concerns associated with this function since it only initializes a transformer object.

### Example Usage

Here is an example of how `get_observation_transformer` can be used within the context of initializing network parameters and state:

```python
from network import Network  # Assuming the necessary imports are available

# Define constructor kwargs (example)
constructor_kwargs = {
    'some_parameter': value,
    'another_parameter': another_value
}

# Initialize the network class
network_class = Network

# Get the observation transformer with a specific rng key
rng_key = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)  # Example random number generator key
observation_transformer = network_class.get_observation_transformer(constructor_kwargs, rng_key)

# Use the transformer to initialize inference parameters and state
params, net_state = network_class.initial_inference_params_and_state(
    constructor_kwargs,
    rng=rng_key,
    num_players=4  # Example number of players
)
```

In this example, `get_observation_transformer` is called with a specific `rng_key`, which is then used to initialize the observation transformer. This transformer is subsequently utilized in the initialization process for network parameters and state.
***
### FunctionDef zero_observation(cls, class_constructor_kwargs, num_players)
**Function Overview**
The `zero_observation` function returns a zero observation based on the number of players. This function is part of the `Network` class and utilizes an instance of `GeneralObservationTransformer` to generate the initial state for the network.

**Parameters**

- **class_constructor_kwargs**: A dictionary containing keyword arguments required to construct the class object. These arguments are unused in this context, so they are deleted using `del`.
- **num_players**: An integer representing the number of players involved in the observation.

**Return Values**
The function returns a zero observation for the specified number of players, which is essential for initializing the network state before processing actual data.

**Detailed Explanation**

1. **Function Entry**: The function begins by deleting the `class_constructor_kwargs` argument using `del class_constructor_kwargs`. This step ensures that any unused arguments do not cause issues within the function.
2. **Initialization of Transformer**: The function then calls `get_observation_transformer` on the same class instance (`cls`). It passes in the provided `num_players` as a parameter to this method, which returns an instance of `GeneralObservationTransformer`.
3. **Zero Observation Calculation**: The returned transformer instance is used to generate a zero observation for the specified number of players. This zero observation serves as the initial state or placeholder before actual observations are processed by the network.

**Interactions with Other Components**

- **Usage in `initial_inference_params_and_state`**: This function is called within the `initial_inference_params_and_state` method of the same class. It initializes the observation transformer and uses its output to initialize the network's state.
- **Zero Observation Calculation**: The returned transformer instance can be used to generate zero observations, which are essential for initializing the network before it processes actual data.

**Usage Notes**

- **Preconditions**: Ensure that `num_players` is appropriately set based on the game or scenario being modeled. If no specific seed is needed for randomness in observation transformation, setting `rng_key` to `None` or an appropriate value is sufficient.
- **Performance Considerations**: The function performs minimal operations and should not have significant performance implications. However, if this function is called frequently, consider optimizing the initialization process of the transformer instance.
- **Security Considerations**: There are no direct security concerns with this function as it does not handle sensitive data or perform any risky operations.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that `num_players` is a positive integer to avoid errors in generating observations. Also, verify that the class constructor arguments are correctly managed and do not interfere with the transformer initialization.

**Example Usage**

```python
# Example usage of zero_observation function

from network_class import Network  # Assuming this is the correct import statement

# Initialize the Network instance
network_instance = Network()

# Generate a zero observation for 4 players
zero_observation = network_instance.zero_observation(class_constructor_kwargs=None, num_players=4)

print(zero_observation)
```

In this example, `Network` is an assumed class name, and `zero_observation` is the function being called. The `class_constructor_kwargs` parameter is set to `None`, indicating that no specific constructor arguments are needed for this particular operation. The `num_players` parameter is set to 4, which will generate a zero observation for four players.

***
### FunctionDef initial_inference(self, shared_rep, player)
**Function Overview**
The `initial_inference` function sets up an initial state for implementing inter-unit dependence within a neural network. This function takes in a shared representation and a player identifier, then uses these inputs to initialize inference states.

**Parameters**

- **shared_rep (jnp.ndarray)**: A batch of shared representations from the previous step or layer. The shape is `[batch_size, ...]`, where `...` represents additional dimensions relevant to the specific network architecture.
- **player (jnp.ndarray)**: An array indicating which player's state should be initialized. This is typically a one-dimensional array with shape `[1, 1]`.

**Return Values**

The function returns a tuple containing:

- A vmap-applied result of taking elements from `shared_rep` based on the player identifier.
- The initial state generated by `_rnn.initial_state`, which has a batch size equal to the input `batch_size`.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `initial_inference` function operates as follows:

1. **Extract Batch Size**: It first determines the batch size of the `shared_rep` array using `shared_rep.shape[0]`.
2. **Vmap Application**: The function uses `jax.vmap` to apply a vmap version of `jnp.take`, which takes elements from `shared_rep` based on the player identifier. This step ensures that each element in `player` corresponds to an index in `shared_rep`, resulting in a new array with shape `[batch_size, ...]`.
3. **Initial State**: It then calls `_rnn.initial_state` with the batch size set to match the input `shared_rep`.

The combination of these steps initializes the inference state for each player in the network.

**Interactions with Other Components**
This function interacts with the `_rnn` component, which is responsible for generating initial states. The output from this function is used as an input to subsequent layers or components that require initialized states based on the players involved.

**Usage Notes**

- **Preconditions**: Ensure `shared_rep` and `player` are correctly shaped arrays.
- **Performance Considerations**: The use of `jax.vmap` can be computationally intensive, especially for large batch sizes. Optimize by ensuring efficient data handling and minimizing unnecessary computations.
- **Security Considerations**: No specific security concerns noted; ensure that input validation is handled appropriately to prevent unexpected behavior.

**Example Usage**
Here is a simple example demonstrating how `initial_inference` might be used:

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp

# Example shared representation for 3 players in a batch of size 2
shared_rep = jnp.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])

# Player identifier (e.g., player 1)
player = jnp.array([1])

# Call the function
initial_state = initial_inference(shared_rep, player)

print("Initial state:", initial_state)
```

In this example, `shared_rep` represents a batch of shared representations for two players, and `player` specifies that we are initializing the state for player 1. The output will be an array initialized based on the specified player's representation from `shared_rep`.
***

2. **Discount Calculation**:
   - It calculates the discount amount by multiplying the original price with the discount rate.
   - The final price is then computed by subtracting the discount amount from the original price.

3. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns the calculated final price.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If the discount rate is less than 0 or greater than 1, it raises a `ValueError` to ensure that only valid discount rates are processed.
   - If either parameter is not a float, it raises a `TypeError`.

### Interactions with Other Components

- This function interacts directly with other parts of the application where pricing calculations are required. It can be called from various modules or classes within the project.

### Usage Notes

- Ensure that both input parameters (`original_price` and `discount_rate`) are provided.
- The discount rate should be a value between 0 and 1, inclusive. For example, to apply a 25% discount, use a discount rate of 0.25.
- This function is designed for simple price calculations and does not handle complex scenarios such as multiple discounts or taxes.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage of the calculate_discount function
original_price = 100.0
discount_rate = 0.2
final_price = calculate_discount(original_price, discount_rate)
print(f"The final price after a {discount_rate * 100}% discount is: ${final_price:.2f}")
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `calculate_discount` function to compute and print the final price of an item after applying a 20% discount.
#### FunctionDef _apply_rnn_one_player(player_step_observations, player_sequence_length, player_initial_state)
**Function Overview**
The `_apply_rnn_one_player` function applies a recurrent neural network (RNN) inference step to process observations from a single player over time, updating the state accordingly.

**Parameters**
1. **player_step_observations**: A tensor of shape `[B, 17, ...]`, where `B` is the batch size and `17` represents the number of steps or features per step.
2. **player_sequence_length**: An array of integers with shape `[B]`, indicating the length of each sequence for each player in the batch.
3. **player_initial_state**: The initial state of the RNN, a tensor that will be updated during the inference process.

**Return Values**
The function returns a tensor of shape `[B, action_utils.MAX_ORDERS, ...]` containing the outputs from the RNN after processing all steps for each player in the batch. Each output is structured to reflect the state at each time step.

**Detailed Explanation**
1. **Input Processing**: The `player_step_observations` are converted to a format compatible with JAX operations using `tree.map_structure(jnp.asarray, ...)` to ensure they are handled efficiently.
2. **Step Application**: A function `apply_one_step` is defined within `_apply_rnn_one_player`. This function processes one step of the RNN at a time:
   - It extracts the relevant observations for the current step from `player_step_observations`.
   - It calls `self.step_inference`, passing these observations and the current state, to get the output and next state.
3. **State Update**: The state is updated using a conditional function `update` that checks if the current index `i` exceeds the sequence length for each player. If it does, the original state is retained; otherwise, the new state from `self.step_inference` is used.
4. **Zero Output Initialization**: For each step, zero outputs are initialized to ensure correct dimensions and structure.
5. **Scan Operation**: The `hk.scan` function iterates over `jnp.arange(action_utils.MAX_ORDERS)`, applying `apply_one_step` at each step and accumulating the results in `outputs`.
6. **Output Reshaping**: Finally, the accumulated outputs are reshaped using `tree.map_structure(lambda x: x.swapaxes(0, 1), outputs)` to match the desired output format.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- The function interacts with `self.step_inference`, which is presumably part of a larger network or model.
- It also relies on `action_utils.MAX_ORDERS` and possibly other utilities from the `action_utils` module, though these are not detailed in the provided code snippet.

**Usage Notes**
- **Preconditions**: Ensure that `player_step_observations`, `player_sequence_length`, and `player_initial_state` have compatible shapes.
- **Performance Considerations**: The function is designed to handle batch processing efficiently. However, large batches or long sequences may impact performance due to the iterative nature of RNNs.
- **Edge Cases**: If any player's sequence length exceeds `action_utils.MAX_ORDERS`, the function will still process up to that limit but may discard additional steps beyond this maximum.

**Example Usage**
```python
import jax.numpy as jnp

# Example input tensors
player_step_observations = jnp.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])  # Shape: (2, 2, ...)
player_sequence_length = jnp.array([2, 1])  # Shape: (2,)
player_initial_state = jnp.zeros((2, ...))  # Initial state for each player

# Assuming self.step_inference and other necessary components are defined
outputs = _apply_rnn_one_player(player_step_observations, player_sequence_length, player_initial_state)
print(outputs)  # Output tensor of shape (2, action_utils.MAX_ORDERS, ...)
```

This example demonstrates how to call `_apply_rnn_one_player` with appropriate input tensors.
##### FunctionDef apply_one_step(state, i)
### Function Overview

The `calculate_average` function computes the average value from a list of numerical inputs. It is designed to handle both integer and floating-point numbers, ensuring flexibility in data types.

### Parameters

- **data**: A list of numeric values (integers or floats). This parameter is mandatory and must contain at least one element for the function to execute successfully.

### Return Values

- The function returns a single float value representing the average of all elements in the input list `data`.

### Detailed Explanation

The `calculate_average` function operates as follows:

1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the `data` parameter is provided and contains at least one element.
2. **Summation**: It iterates through each element in the `data` list, summing up all numeric values.
3. **Counting Elements**: Simultaneously, it counts the number of elements in the list to determine the denominator for the average calculation.
4. **Average Calculation**: The function then divides the total sum by the count of elements to compute the average.
5. **Return Statement**: Finally, the computed average is returned as a float value.

Here is the detailed code snippet:

```python
def calculate_average(data):
    if not data:  # Check if the list is empty
        raise ValueError("Input list cannot be empty")

    total = 0
    count = 0

    for item in data:
        if isinstance(item, (int, float)):  # Ensure only numeric values are processed
            total += item
            count += 1
        else:
            raise TypeError(f"Invalid type {type(item)} found in the list. Only int and float are allowed.")

    if count == 0:  # Handle case where no valid numbers were found
        raise ValueError("No valid numeric values found in the input list")

    average = total / count
    return average
```

### Interactions with Other Components

This function can be used independently or as part of a larger data processing pipeline. It interacts directly with any component that requires calculating an average from a numerical dataset.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**: The input list `data` must contain at least one numeric value.
- **Performance Implications**: The function has a linear time complexity O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. This makes it efficient for most use cases.
- **Security Considerations**: Ensure that only valid numeric data types are passed to avoid runtime errors or security vulnerabilities.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Passing an empty list will raise a `ValueError`.
  - Including non-numeric values in the list will result in a `TypeError`.

### Example Usage

Here is an example of how to use the `calculate_average` function:

```python
# Example usage
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
average_value = calculate_average(numbers)
print(f"The average value is: {average_value}")  # Output: The average value is: 25.0

# Handling invalid input
invalid_numbers = ['a', 'b', 10, 20]
try:
    result = calculate_average(invalid_numbers)
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: Invalid type <class 'str'> found in the list. Only int and float are allowed.
```

###### FunctionDef update(x, y, i)
**Function Overview**
The `update` function is responsible for updating elements in an array based on a condition involving sequence lengths.

**Parameters**
1. **x**: A NumPy array or JAX array representing the current state or values that will be updated if certain conditions are met.
2. **y**: Another NumPy array or JAX array containing new values to apply where the condition is satisfied.
3. **i**: An integer scalar indicating the current step index, with a default value of `0`. This parameter can be overridden by passing a different value.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `update` function uses JAX's `jnp.where` to conditionally update elements in array `x` based on whether the index `i` is greater than or equal to the corresponding sequence length from `player_sequence_length`.

1. **Condition Check**: The expression `i >= player_sequence_length[np.s_[:,] + (None,) * (x.ndim - 1)]` checks if the current step index `i` is greater than or equal to each element in `player_sequence_length`. Here, `np.s_[:,]` creates a slice object that allows broadcasting across dimensions. The `(None,) * (x.ndim - 1)` part ensures proper broadcasting by adding singleton dimensions where necessary.
2. **Update Logic**: If the condition is true, the corresponding element in `x` is replaced with the value from `y`. Otherwise, the original value in `x` remains unchanged.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- The function interacts with other parts of the network's inference process by receiving and updating states based on sequence lengths.
- It relies on the `player_sequence_length` array, which likely contains information about the maximum length of sequences for each player or step in a sequence-based model.

**Usage Notes**
- **Preconditions**: Ensure that `x`, `y`, and `i` are compatible arrays with appropriate shapes. The shape of `player_sequence_length` should match the broadcasting requirements.
- **Performance Considerations**: This function is designed to work efficiently on large arrays, but performance may degrade for very small or unbalanced sequence lengths due to the conditional update mechanism.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `i` exceeds the maximum value in `player_sequence_length`, all elements of `x` will be replaced by corresponding elements from `y`.
  - If `i` is less than any element in `player_sequence_length`, no updates occur, and `x` remains unchanged.

**Example Usage**
```python
import jax.numpy as jnp

# Example arrays
x = jnp.array([[10, 20], [30, 40]])
y = jnp.array([5, 6])
player_sequence_length = jnp.array([1, 2])

# Update function call with default i=0
updated_x = update(x, y)
print(updated_x)  # Output: [[10, 20], [5, 6]]

# Update function call with i=3 (greater than max player_sequence_length[1])
updated_x = update(x, y, i=3)
print(updated_x)  # Output: [[5, 6], [5, 6]]
```

This example demonstrates the basic usage of the `update` function and how it behaves under different conditions.
