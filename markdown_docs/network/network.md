## FunctionDef normalize_adjacency(adjacency)
**normalize_adjacency**: The function of normalize_adjacency is to compute the symmetric normalized Laplacian of an adjacency matrix.

parameters: 
· adjacency: map adjacency matrix without self-connections.

Code Description: The normalize_adjacency function takes an input adjacency matrix, which represents connections between nodes in a graph but does not include self-connections (i.e., no node is connected to itself). The function first adds the identity matrix to the adjacency matrix to account for these self-connections. It then calculates the degree matrix D, where each diagonal element d_ii is the inverse square root of the sum of the i-th row of the updated adjacency matrix. This degree matrix is used to normalize the adjacency matrix symmetrically by computing D * adjacency * D. The result is a symmetric normalized Laplacian matrix that is often utilized in graph-based machine learning models, such as GraphConvNets.

In the context of the project, this function is called within the Network class's constructor. Specifically, it is used to normalize the adjacency matrices for both areas and provinces based on map data files (MDF). These normalized Laplacian matrices are then passed to BoardEncoder instances, which play a crucial role in encoding board states for further processing in the neural network.

Note: It is important that the input adjacency matrix does not contain self-connections before being passed to this function. The function assumes that the adjacency matrix is square and symmetric (excluding self-connections).

Output Example: Given an adjacency matrix `[[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]]`, the output would be a normalized Laplacian matrix such as `[[1.0, -0.5, 0.0], [-0.5, 1.0, -0.5], [0.0, -0.5, 1.0]]`. The exact values may vary slightly due to floating-point arithmetic precision.
## ClassDef EncoderCore
**EncoderCore**: The function of EncoderCore is to perform one round of message passing on graph-structured data using non-shared weights across nodes.

attributes: 
· adjacency: [NUM_AREAS, NUM_AREAS] symmetric normalized Laplacian of the adjacency matrix.
· filter_size: output size of per-node linear layer.
· batch_norm_config: config dict for hk.BatchNorm.
· name: a name for the module.
· _adjacency: stores the provided adjacency matrix.
· _filter_size: stores the filter size for the linear layer.
· _bn: an instance of hk.BatchNorm configured with specified parameters.

Code Description: 
The EncoderCore class is designed to handle graph data where nodes represent areas and edges are defined by a symmetric normalized Laplacian adjacency matrix. It performs message passing, which is a fundamental operation in graph neural networks (GNNs). During the initialization phase, it accepts an adjacency matrix and other parameters such as filter size for linear layers and configuration for batch normalization. The class uses these to set up its internal state.

In the `__call__` method, EncoderCore processes input tensors representing node features through a series of operations: 
1. It creates a weight parameter `w` using hk.get_parameter with a shape derived from the input tensor dimensions and filter size.
2. It computes messages by performing an einsum operation between the input tensors and weights `w`.
3. These messages are then aggregated for each node based on the adjacency matrix, representing how information flows through the graph.
4. The aggregated messages are concatenated with the original messages to form a new representation of nodes.
5. Batch normalization is applied to stabilize training and improve performance.
6. Finally, a ReLU activation function is used to introduce non-linearity.

This class is utilized by other components in the project such as BoardEncoder and RelationalOrderDecoder. In BoardEncoder, multiple instances of EncoderCore are created for shared and player-specific layers, allowing it to handle complex graph structures with different types of information. Similarly, RelationalOrderDecoder uses EncoderCore to process province-level adjacency matrices, enabling it to perform relational reasoning tasks.

Note: 
Ensure that the provided adjacency matrix is a symmetric normalized Laplacian as expected by this class. The filter size and batch normalization configuration can be adjusted based on specific requirements of the application.

Output Example: 
Given an input tensor of shape [B, NUM_AREAS, REP_SIZE], where B is the batch size, NUM_AREAS is the number of areas (nodes), and REP_SIZE is the representation size of each node, EncoderCore will output a tensor of shape [B, NUM_AREAS, 2 * filter_size]. This output represents the updated node features after one round of message passing.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, adjacency)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the EncoderCore class with specified parameters.

parameters:
· adjacency: [NUM_AREAS, NUM_AREAS] symmetric normalized Laplacian of the adjacency matrix.
· filter_size: output size of per-node linear layer. Default value is 32.
· batch_norm_config: config dict for hk.BatchNorm. Default value is None.
· name: a name for the module. Default value is "encoder_core".

Code Description:
The __init__ function initializes an instance of the EncoderCore class with the provided parameters. It first calls the constructor of the superclass using `super().__init__(name=name)`, passing the name parameter to it. The adjacency matrix, which should be a symmetric normalized Laplacian, is stored in the private attribute `_adjacency`. The filter size for the per-node linear layer is stored in the private attribute `_filter_size`.

The function then sets up a default configuration dictionary `bnc` for batch normalization with keys 'decay_rate', 'eps', 'create_scale', and 'create_offset' set to 0.9, 1e-5, True, and True respectively. If a custom batch_norm_config is provided, it updates the default configuration dictionary `bnc` with the values from the provided config. The updated configuration is then used to create an instance of hk.BatchNorm, which is stored in the private attribute `_bn`.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
Ensure that the adjacency matrix provided is a symmetric normalized Laplacian as required by the function. The filter_size should be chosen based on the specific requirements of the model architecture. If custom batch normalization settings are needed, they should be passed in the `batch_norm_config` dictionary following the expected keys and value types.
***
### FunctionDef __call__(self, tensors)
**__call__**: The function of __call__ is to perform one round of message passing on input tensors.

parameters: 
· tensors: This parameter represents the input data with shape [B, NUM_AREAS, REP_SIZE], where B is the batch size, NUM_AREAS is the number of areas or nodes, and REP_SIZE is the representation size of each node.
· is_training: A boolean flag indicating whether the current operation is during training (default is False).

Code Description: 
The __call__ function performs a single round of message passing in a graph neural network. It starts by defining a weight matrix 'w' using Haiku's get_parameter method, which initializes weights with shape [NUM_AREAS, REP_SIZE, FILTER_SIZE] and uses VarianceScaling for initialization. The messages are then computed as the product of the input tensors and the weight matrix 'w' through an einsum operation, resulting in a tensor of shape [B, NUM_AREAS, FILTER_SIZE]. These messages are aggregated by multiplying with the adjacency matrix self._adjacency, which combines information from neighboring nodes. The aggregated messages are concatenated with the original messages along the last axis to form a new tensor of shape [B, NUM_AREAS, 2 * FILTER_SIZE]. This combined tensor is then passed through a batch normalization layer self._bn, with the is_training flag indicating whether it's in training mode or not. Finally, the output tensor undergoes a ReLU activation function before being returned.

Note: The adjacency matrix self._adjacency and filter size self._filter_size are assumed to be predefined attributes of the class instance. Ensure that these attributes are correctly initialized before calling this method.

Output Example: 
Assuming B=2 (batch size), NUM_AREAS=3, REP_SIZE=4, and FILTER_SIZE=5, the output tensor will have a shape of [2, 3, 10]. Each element in the batch will contain aggregated messages from neighboring nodes concatenated with the original messages, followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation.
***
## ClassDef BoardEncoder
**BoardEncoder**: The function of BoardEncoder is to encode board state representations by constructing a shared representation that does not depend on the specific player and then incorporating player-specific information.

attributes: 
· adjacency: [NUM_AREAS, NUM_AREAS] symmetric normalized Laplacian of the adjacency matrix.
· shared_filter_size: filter size of each EncoderCore for shared layers (default is 32).
· player_filter_size: filter size of each EncoderCore for player-specific layers (default is 32).
· num_shared_cores: number of shared layers, or rounds of message passing (default is 8).
· num_player_cores: number of player-specific layers, or rounds of message passing (default is 8).
· num_players: number of players (default is 7).
· num_seasons: number of seasons (default is utils.NUM_SEASONS).
· player_embedding_size: size of player embedding (default is 16).
· season_embedding_size: size of season embedding (default is 16).
· min_init_embedding: minimum value for hk.initializers.RandomUniform for player and season embedding (default is -1.0).
· max_init_embedding: maximum value for hk.initializers.RandomUniform for player and season embedding (default is 1.0).
· batch_norm_config: configuration dictionary for hk.BatchNorm.
· name: a name for this module (default is "board_encoder").

Code Description: The BoardEncoder class constructs a representation of the board state, organized per-area. It takes into account the season in the game, the specific power (player) being considered, and the number of builds available to that player. Both the season and player are embedded before being included in the representation. A shared representation is first constructed through several layers of message passing, which does not depend on the specific player. Player-specific information is then incorporated into this shared representation through additional layers of message passing.

The class initializes embeddings for seasons and players using hk.Embed with random uniform initializers. It also sets up multiple EncoderCore instances for both shared and player-specific layers. During the forward pass (in the __call__ method), it first creates a context vector by embedding the season and tiling it across all areas, then concatenates this context with the state representation and build numbers. The shared encoding process is performed using the shared EncoderCore instances followed by message passing through additional shared cores.

Next, player-specific embeddings are created and concatenated to the shared representation for each player. Player-specific encoding is then applied using the player-specific EncoderCore instances, again followed by message passing through additional player cores. Finally, batch normalization is applied to the resulting representation before it is returned.

Note: The BoardEncoder class is used within the Network class to encode board states and last moves actions. It plays a crucial role in transforming raw board data into a more meaningful representation that can be used for further processing by other components of the network, such as RNNs and MLPs.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value is a tensor with shape [B, NUM_AREAS, 2 * self._player_filter_size], where B is the batch size, NUM_AREAS is the number of areas on the board, and self._player_filter_size is the filter size specified for player-specific layers. This tensor represents the encoded board state, incorporating both shared and player-specific information.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, adjacency)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the BoardEncoder module with specified parameters for handling graph-structured data.

parameters: 
· adjacency: [NUM_AREAS, NUM_AREAS] symmetric normalized Laplacian of the adjacency matrix.
· shared_filter_size: filter_size of each EncoderCore for shared layers. Default value is 32.
· player_filter_size: filter_size of each EncoderCore for player-specific layers. Default value is 32.
· num_shared_cores: number of shared layers, or rounds of message passing. Default value is 8.
· num_player_cores: number of player-specific layers, or rounds of message passing. Default value is 8.
· num_players: number of players. Default value is 7.
· num_seasons: number of seasons. Default value is utils.NUM_SEASONS.
· player_embedding_size: size of player embedding. Default value is 16.
· season_embedding_size: size of season embedding. Default value is 16.
· min_init_embedding: min value for hk.initializers.RandomUniform for player and season embedding. Default value is -1.0.
· max_init_embedding: max value for hk.initializers.RandomUniform for player and season embedding. Default value is 1.0.
· batch_norm_config: config dict for hk.BatchNorm. Default value is None.
· name: a name for this module. Default value is "board_encoder".

Code Description: The __init__ method initializes the BoardEncoder module with various parameters that define its behavior in processing graph-structured data. It sets up embeddings for players and seasons using hk.Embed, which are initialized with random values within the specified range (min_init_embedding to max_init_embedding). These embeddings play a crucial role in representing different players and seasons in the model.

The method also creates instances of EncoderCore for both shared and player-specific layers. The number of these cores is determined by num_shared_cores and num_player_cores, respectively. Each core is configured with the provided adjacency matrix and batch normalization settings, enabling them to perform message passing on the graph data. This setup allows the BoardEncoder to handle complex interactions between different areas (nodes) in the graph while considering both shared information and player-specific details.

Batch normalization is configured using a default set of parameters that can be overridden by providing a custom batch_norm_config dictionary. The resulting configuration is stored in self._bn, which will be used during the message passing process to stabilize training and improve performance.

Note: Ensure that the provided adjacency matrix is a symmetric normalized Laplacian as expected by this class. Adjusting the filter sizes, number of cores, embedding dimensions, and batch normalization settings can help tailor the model to specific requirements of the application.
***
### FunctionDef __call__(self, state_representation, season, build_numbers, is_training)
**__call__**: The function of __call__ is to encode the board state by integrating various contextual information such as season and build numbers.

parameters: 
· state_representation: A JAX NumPy array representing the state of the board with shape [B, NUM_AREAS, REP_SIZE], where B is the batch size, NUM_AREAS is the number of areas on the board, and REP_SIZE is the size of the representation for each area.
· season: A JAX NumPy array indicating the current season with shape [B, 1].
· build_numbers: A JAX NumPy array representing the build numbers with shape [B, 1].
· is_training: A boolean flag indicating whether the function is being called during training.

Code Description: The __call__ method encodes the board state by first creating a season context and tiling it across all areas in the batch. It then converts the build numbers to float32 and tiles them similarly. These contextual embeddings are concatenated with the original state representation along the last axis. The combined representation is then passed through a shared encoding layer followed by several residual layers defined in self._shared_core.

Next, player-specific embeddings are created and tiled across all areas and players. The current board representation is also tiled to match this shape, and the player embeddings are concatenated with it. This new representation is then processed through a player-specific encoding layer and additional residual layers defined in self._player_core. Finally, batch normalization is applied to the output before returning.

Note: Ensure that the input arrays have the correct shapes as specified in the parameters section. The method assumes that certain attributes like _season_embedding, _shared_encode, _shared_core, _player_embedding, _player_encode, _player_core, and _bn are properly initialized elsewhere in the class.

Output Example: A JAX NumPy array with shape [B, NUM_AREAS, 2 * self._player_filter_size], representing the encoded board state with integrated contextual information.
***
## ClassDef RecurrentOrderNetworkInput
**RecurrentOrderNetworkInput**: The function of RecurrentOrderNetworkInput is to encapsulate the necessary input data required by the recurrent order network for processing in decision-making tasks.

attributes: The attributes of this Class.
· average_area_representation: A jnp.ndarray representing the averaged area representation, typically with shape [B*PLAYERS, REP_SIZE].
· legal_actions_mask: A jnp.ndarray indicating which actions are legal for each player, usually shaped as [B*PLAYERS, MAX_ACTION_INDEX].
· teacher_forcing: A jnp.ndarray used during training to provide ground truth actions, shaped as [B*PLAYERS].
· previous_teacher_forcing_action: A jnp.ndarray representing the last action provided by teacher forcing, also with shape [B*PLAYERS].
· temperature: A jnp.ndarray that controls the randomness of sampling during inference, typically shaped as [B*PLAYERS, 1].

Code Description: The RecurrentOrderNetworkInput class is a NamedTuple designed to hold structured input data for a recurrent neural network specifically tailored for order-based decision-making tasks. This class encapsulates five key attributes essential for the network's operation:

- average_area_representation: This attribute holds the averaged representation of areas relevant to each player, which serves as a foundational input for the network to understand the current state of the environment.
  
- legal_actions_mask: This binary mask indicates which actions are permissible for each player at any given step. It is crucial for guiding the network towards making valid decisions by eliminating illegal options.

- teacher_forcing: During training, this attribute provides ground truth actions to the network, facilitating supervised learning and enabling the model to learn from correct sequences of actions.

- previous_teacher_forcing_action: This attribute stores the last action that was provided through teacher forcing. It is used in conjunction with other inputs to maintain consistency and context across sequential steps during training.

- temperature: This parameter controls the randomness of the sampling process during inference. By adjusting the temperature, one can influence the exploration-exploitation trade-off, making it possible to generate more diverse or deterministic actions as needed.

In the project, RecurrentOrderNetworkInput is utilized by two primary functions: `RelationalOrderDecoder.__call__` and `Network.step_inference`. In `RelationalOrderDecoder.__call__`, this input class provides essential data for issuing orders based on the current board representation and previous decisions. The function processes these inputs alongside a previous state to generate logits representing potential actions, which are then used to update the decoder's internal state.

Similarly, in `Network.step_inference`, RecurrentOrderNetworkInput is constructed from step observations and passed to the recurrent neural network (RNN) for generating action logits during inference. This function also updates the internal state of the network based on the current inputs and outputs relevant information such as actions, legal action masks, policies, and logits.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
When using RecurrentOrderNetworkInput, ensure that all attributes are correctly shaped and formatted according to their descriptions. Properly setting these attributes is crucial for the correct functioning of the network during both training and inference phases. Additionally, pay attention to the temperature parameter when performing inference to achieve the desired balance between exploration and exploitation in action sampling.
## FunctionDef previous_action_from_teacher_or_sample(teacher_forcing, previous_teacher_forcing_action, previous_sampled_action_index)
**previous_action_from_teacher_or_sample**: The function of previous_action_from_teacher_or_sample is to determine the previous action based on whether teacher forcing is applied or not.

parameters: 
· teacher_forcing: A jnp.ndarray indicating whether teacher forcing should be used.
· previous_teacher_forcing_action: A jnp.ndarray representing the previous action provided by the teacher during training.
· previous_sampled_action_index: A jnp.ndarray containing the index of the previously sampled action during inference.

Code Description: The function uses a conditional statement (jnp.where) to decide whether to return the previous action from the teacher or from the sampled actions. If `teacher_forcing` is True, it returns `previous_teacher_forcing_action`. Otherwise, it retrieves the action from the list of possible actions using the index specified in `previous_sampled_action_index`, after shrinking the actions using `action_utils.shrink_actions`.

This function plays a crucial role in the RelationalOrderDecoder class's __call__ method. In the context of training, when teacher forcing is enabled, the model receives the correct previous action from the dataset to guide its learning process. During inference or when teacher forcing is disabled, the model uses the previously sampled action index to determine the previous action, allowing it to generate actions autonomously.

Note: Ensure that `teacher_forcing`, `previous_teacher_forcing_action`, and `previous_sampled_action_index` are correctly shaped jnp.ndarrays as expected by this function. Misalignment in dimensions can lead to runtime errors or incorrect behavior.

Output Example: If teacher_forcing is True, the output will be the value of previous_teacher_forcing_action. For example, if previous_teacher_forcing_action is [1, 2, 3], the output will be [1, 2, 3]. If teacher_forcing is False and previous_sampled_action_index is [0, 1, 2], assuming action_utils.shrink_actions(action_utils.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS) results in [10, 20, 30], the output will be [10, 20, 30].
## FunctionDef one_hot_provinces_for_all_actions
**one_hot_provinces_for_all_actions**: The function of one_hot_provinces_for_all_actions is to generate a one-hot encoded matrix representing all possible provinces associated with each action.

parameters: The parameters of this Function.
· This function does not take any explicit parameters.

Code Description: The description of this Function.
The function `one_hot_provinces_for_all_actions` generates a one-hot encoded matrix where each row corresponds to an action from the set of possible actions (`action_utils.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS`). Each column in the matrix represents a province, and the number of columns is determined by `utils.NUM_PROVINCES`. The value at each position in the matrix indicates whether the corresponding province is associated with the action (1) or not (0). This one-hot encoding is achieved using `jax.nn.one_hot` on the ordered provinces derived from the possible actions.

The function is called within two different parts of the project:
1. In `blocked_provinces_and_actions`, it is used to determine which actions are blocked based on the current state of blocked provinces. The one-hot encoded matrix helps in identifying which provinces are affected by a given action, aiding in the calculation of illegal actions.
2. In `RelationalOrderDecoder.__call__`, it assists in constructing the representation of legal actions for each province. By multiplying the legal actions mask with the one-hot encoded provinces, it ensures that only valid actions for each province are considered during the order issuance process.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
This function does not require any input parameters and is designed to work with predefined constants (`action_utils.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS` and `utils.NUM_PROVINCES`). It is crucial that these constants are correctly defined in the project for the function to produce accurate results. The output matrix is used extensively in determining legal actions and blocked provinces, so its correctness is vital for the overall functionality of the system.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Assuming there are 5 possible actions and 10 provinces, the output could look like this:
```
[[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]
```
Each row corresponds to an action, and each column represents a province. The value of 1 indicates that the province is associated with the corresponding action.
## FunctionDef blocked_provinces_and_actions(previous_action, previous_blocked_provinces)
**blocked_provinces_and_actions**: The function of blocked_provinces_and_actions is to calculate which provinces and actions are illegal based on previous decisions.

parameters: 
· previous_action: A jnp.ndarray representing the most recent action taken, where each element encodes multiple pieces of information about an action through bit manipulation.
· previous_blocked_provinces: A jnp.ndarray indicating which provinces were previously blocked by past decisions.

Code Description: The function `blocked_provinces_and_actions` calculates and updates the list of blocked provinces based on the most recent action (`previous_action`) and any provinces that were already blocked (`previous_blocked_provinces`). It first computes an updated set of blocked provinces using the `ordered_provinces_one_hot` function, which generates a one-hot encoded representation of provinces associated with actions greater than 0 and not marked as waived. The maximum operation between the previous blocked provinces and this new encoding ensures that any province blocked in either state remains blocked.

Next, it calculates which actions are blocked by multiplying the one-hot encoded matrix from `one_hot_provinces_for_all_actions` (representing all possible provinces for each action) with the updated blocked provinces array. This multiplication identifies actions that involve blocked provinces and marks them as illegal. The result is then adjusted to exclude any "waive" actions, which are determined using the `is_waive` function.

The function returns two arrays: `updated_blocked_provinces`, which contains the updated list of blocked provinces after considering the most recent action, and `blocked_actions`, a binary array indicating which actions are illegal due to involving blocked provinces or being "waive" actions.

In the context of its caller in the project, `RelationalOrderDecoder.__call__` uses `blocked_provinces_and_actions` to determine which provinces and actions are illegal based on previous game state decisions. This information is crucial for constructing a valid set of legal actions that can be considered during the order issuance process.

Note: The function assumes that certain utility functions (like those from action_utils) and constants (like utils.NUM_PROVINCES) are correctly defined elsewhere in the project. It is crucial that these dependencies are properly set up for the function to work as intended.

Output Example: Assuming there are 5 provinces and 3 actions, with previous_action = [1, 0, 2] and previous_blocked_provinces = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], the output could be:
updated_blocked_provinces = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
blocked_actions = [0, 1, 0]

This indicates that provinces 1 and 3 are blocked after considering the most recent action, and only the second action is illegal due to involving a blocked province.
## FunctionDef sample_from_logits(logits, legal_action_mask, temperature)
**sample_from_logits**: The function of sample_from_logits is to sample an action from logits while respecting a legal actions mask.

parameters: 
· logits: jnp.ndarray - An array containing raw unnormalized scores for each possible action.
· legal_action_mask: jnp.ndarray - A boolean mask indicating which actions are legal.
· temperature: jnp.ndarray - A scalar or array that controls the randomness of sampling, where lower values make the distribution more deterministic.

Code Description: 
The function sample_from_logits is designed to select an action from a set of possible actions based on their logits (unnormalized scores) while ensuring that only legal actions are considered. It handles both stochastic and deterministic sampling depending on the temperature parameter. 

Firstly, it computes deterministic logits by setting the score of the highest scoring illegal action to negative infinity, effectively making it impossible to select. This is achieved using jnp.where and jax.nn.one_hot functions.

Secondly, it calculates stochastic logits by dividing the logits by the temperature for legal actions and setting the scores of illegal actions to negative infinity. This step ensures that the sampling process respects the legal action mask while allowing for randomness controlled by the temperature parameter.

The function then selects between deterministic and stochastic logits based on whether the temperature is zero or not, using another jnp.where call.

Finally, it samples an action from the computed logits using jax.random.categorical. The random key for this operation is generated using hk.next_rng_key(), ensuring reproducibility when needed.

In the context of the project, sample_from_logits is called within the __call__ method of RelationalOrderDecoder. Here, it receives order logits and a legal actions mask as inputs, along with a temperature value that controls the randomness of action selection. The sampled action index returned by sample_from_logits is then used to update the decoder's state, reflecting the decision made for the current province.

Note: 
The function assumes that the logits array has shape [B*PLAYERS, MAX_ACTION_INDEX], where B is the batch size and PLAYERS is the number of players. The legal_action_mask should have the same shape as logits, with True indicating a legal action and False an illegal one. The temperature parameter can be a scalar or an array of shape [B*PLAYERS, 1].

Output Example: 
A possible output of sample_from_logits could be an array of shape [B*PLAYERS] containing sampled action indices for each player in the batch. For example, if B=2 and PLAYERS=3, the output might look like [5, 10, 3, 7, 2, 8], where each number represents an index corresponding to a legal action selected from the logits provided.
## ClassDef RelationalOrderDecoderState
**RelationalOrderDecoderState**: The function of RelationalOrderDecoderState is to encapsulate the state information required by the RelationalOrderDecoder during the order generation process.
attributes: The attributes of this Class.
· prev_orders: A jnp.ndarray representing the previous orders made, with shape [B*PLAYERS, NUM_PROVINCES, 2 * self._filter_size].
· blocked_provinces: A jnp.ndarray indicating which provinces are currently blocked for action, with shape [B*PLAYERS, NUM_PROVINCES].
· sampled_action_index: A jnp.ndarray containing the index of the last sampled action, with shape [B*PLAYER].

Code Description: The RelationalOrderDecoderState class is a NamedTuple designed to store and manage the state information necessary for the RelationalOrderDecoder during its operation. This state includes previous orders made by players, provinces that are currently blocked from taking actions, and the index of the last action sampled. These attributes are crucial for maintaining context across multiple steps in the order generation process.

The class is utilized within the RelationalOrderDecoder's __call__ method, where it serves as both an input parameter (prev_state) and a return value. During each call to __call__, the decoder uses the information contained in prev_state to generate new orders based on the current board representation and legal actions available. The updated state is then returned, reflecting the changes made during this step.

Additionally, the initial_state method of RelationalOrderDecoder initializes an instance of RelationalOrderDecoderState with zero values for all attributes, setting up the starting point for the order generation process. This initialization ensures that the decoder begins with a clean slate, free from any pre-existing state information.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
When using RelationalOrderDecoderState, ensure that the shapes of the arrays match those expected by the RelationalOrderDecoder methods. Specifically, prev_orders should have dimensions [B*PLAYERS, NUM_PROVINCES, 2 * self._filter_size], blocked_provinces should be [B*PLAYERS, NUM_PROVINCES], and sampled_action_index should be [B*PLAYER]. Failure to adhere to these shapes can result in errors during the execution of the decoder methods.
## ClassDef RelationalOrderDecoder
**RelationalOrderDecoder**: The function of RelationalOrderDecoder is to output order logits for a unit based on the current board representation and the orders selected for other units so far.

attributes: The attributes of this Class.
· adjacency: [NUM_PROVINCES, NUM_PROVINCES] symmetric normalized Laplacian of the per-province adjacency matrix.
· filter_size: Filter size for relational cores (default is 32).
· num_cores: Number of relational cores (default is 4).
· batch_norm_config: Configuration dictionary for hk.BatchNorm.
· name: Module's name (default is "relational_order_decoder").
· _filter_size: Internal storage of the filter size.
· _encode: An instance of EncoderCore used for initial encoding.
· _cores: A list of relational cores, each an instance of EncoderCore.
· _projection_size: Size of the projection layer, calculated as 2 times the filter size.
· _bn: Batch normalization layer.

Code Description: The RelationalOrderDecoder class extends hk.RNNCore and is designed to generate order logits for units in a game or simulation based on the current state of the board and previously selected orders. It initializes with an adjacency matrix representing the connections between provinces, along with parameters that define the architecture of its internal components such as filter size, number of cores, and batch normalization settings.

The class includes several methods:
- `_scatter_to_province`: Scatters a vector to specific locations in the input tensor based on one-hot encoded scatter indices.
- `_gather_province`: Gathers vectors from specific locations in the input tensor using one-hot encoded gather indices.
- `_relational_core`: Applies a series of relational cores to the current province and previous decisions, incorporating batch normalization at the end.
- `__call__`: The main method that takes inputs (RecurrentOrderNetworkInput) and the previous state (RelationalOrderDecoderState), processes them through the relational core, and returns order logits along with an updated state. It handles teacher forcing during training, updates blocked provinces based on previous actions, and ensures that illegal actions are eliminated from consideration.
- `initial_state`: Initializes the state of the decoder with zero values for previous orders, blocked provinces, and sampled action indices.

Note: The class assumes the existence of several utility functions such as `previous_action_from_teacher_or_sample`, `blocked_provinces_and_actions`, `ordered_provinces`, `one_hot_provinces_for_all_actions`, `sample_from_logits`, and constants like `action_utils.MAX_ACTION_INDEX` and `utils.NUM_PROVINCES`. These should be defined elsewhere in the project.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
- order_logits: A tensor of shape [B*PLAYERS, MAX_ACTION_INDEX] representing the logits for each action that can be taken by each player in the batch.
- updated_state: An instance of RelationalOrderDecoderState with updated values for prev_orders, blocked_provinces, and sampled_action_index.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, adjacency)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of RelationalOrderDecoder with specified parameters including adjacency matrix, filter size, number of cores, batch normalization configuration, and module name.

parameters: 
· adjacency: [NUM_PROVINCES, NUM_PROVINCES] symmetric normalized Laplacian of the per-province adjacency matrix.
· filter_size: filter_size for relational cores
· num_cores: number of relational cores
· batch_norm_config: config dict for hk.BatchNorm
· name: module's name.

Code Description: The __init__ method initializes a RelationalOrderDecoder object with the provided parameters. It starts by calling the superclass constructor with the specified module name. The filter size is stored internally as _filter_size. An EncoderCore instance, named _encode, is created using the adjacency matrix and other relevant parameters such as filter size and batch normalization configuration. This encoder core will be used for initial encoding of the input data.

A list named _cores is initialized to store multiple EncoderCore instances, which are added in a loop based on the specified number of cores (num_cores). Each core is created with the same adjacency matrix, filter size, and batch normalization configuration as the initial encoder. This setup allows the RelationalOrderDecoder to perform multiple rounds of message passing using distinct sets of weights.

The _projection_size attribute is set to twice the filter size, representing the combined dimensionality of node features and messages after concatenation in the EncoderCore's forward pass.

A default batch normalization configuration (bnc) is defined with parameters such as decay rate, epsilon value, and flags for creating scale and offset. This default configuration can be overridden or extended by providing a custom batch_norm_config dictionary during initialization. The final batch normalization layer (_bn) is created using the merged configuration.

Note: Ensure that the provided adjacency matrix is a symmetric normalized Laplacian as expected by this class. Adjust the filter size, number of cores, and batch normalization configuration based on specific requirements of your application to optimize performance and accuracy.

### FunctionDef _scatter_to_province(self, vector, scatter)
_scatter_to_province: The function of _scatter_to_province is to scatter a vector to its province location based on a one-hot encoded scatter array.

parameters:
· vector: A jnp.ndarray with shape [B*PLAYERS, REP_SIZE] representing the average area representation for each player in a batch.
· scatter: A jnp.ndarray with shape [B*PLAYER, NUM_PROVINCES] that is a one-hot encoding indicating which province each player's vector should be scattered to.

Code Description:
The _scatter_to_province function takes two parameters: 'vector' and 'scatter'. The 'vector' parameter contains the average area representation for each player in a batch, while the 'scatter' parameter is a one-hot encoded array that specifies the target province location for each player's vector. The function performs an element-wise multiplication between the expanded dimensions of 'vector' and 'scatter', effectively scattering the vectors to their respective province locations as prescribed by the scatter array. This operation results in a new jnp.ndarray with shape [B*PLAYERS, NUM_PROVINCES, REP_SIZE], where each player's vector has been added at the location specified by the one-hot encoding in the scatter array.

The function is called within the __call__ method of the RelationalOrderDecoder class. In this context, _scatter_to_province is used to place the representation of the province currently under consideration into the appropriate slot in the graph. This is achieved by scattering the 'average_area_representation' from the inputs based on the legal actions provinces, which are one-hot encoded. Additionally, it is also used to scatter the previous order representation into its corresponding province location in the graph.

Note: The function assumes that the dimensions of the input arrays are compatible for broadcasting during multiplication. It is crucial that 'scatter' is a one-hot encoding array with the correct shape to ensure proper scattering of the vectors.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a jnp.ndarray with shape [B*PLAYERS, NUM_PROVINCES, REP_SIZE], where each slice along the first dimension corresponds to a player in the batch, and within each slice, the vector is scattered across the provinces according to the one-hot encoding provided by 'scatter'. For example, if there are 2 players (B=1, PLAYERS=2), 3 provinces (NUM_PROVINCES=3), and a representation size of 4 (REP_SIZE=4), the output could look like this:

[
    [
        [0., 0., 0., 0.],
        [v1_1, v1_2, v1_3, v1_4],  # Player 1's vector scattered to province 2
        [0., 0., 0., 0.]
    ],
    [
        [v2_1, v2_2, v2_3, v2_4],  # Player 2's vector scattered to province 1
        [0., 0., 0., 0.],
        [0., 0., 0., 0.]
    ]
]
***
### FunctionDef _gather_province(self, inputs, gather)
_gather_province: The function of _gather_province is to gather specific province location representations from the input data based on a one-hot encoded gather array.

parameters:
· inputs: A jnp.ndarray with shape [B*PLAYERS, NUM_PROVINCES, REP_SIZE], representing the board representation for each player and province.
· gather: A jnp.ndarray with shape [B*PLAYERS, NUM_PROVINCES] that serves as a one-hot encoding indicating which provinces to gather from the inputs.

Code Description:
The _gather_province function is designed to extract specific representations of provinces from a larger set of board representations. It takes two parameters: 'inputs', which contains the full representation for each player and province, and 'gather', which is a one-hot encoded array specifying which provinces should be selected. The function multiplies the inputs by the gather array (expanded along the last dimension to match shapes), effectively zeroing out all but the specified provinces for each player. It then sums over the NUM_PROVINCES axis to aggregate the representations of the selected provinces, resulting in a final shape of [B*PLAYERS, REP_SIZE]. This aggregated representation is used later in the RelationalOrderDecoder's __call__ method to construct order logits based on the province and previous orders' representations.

Note: The function assumes that the 'gather' array is correctly one-hot encoded. If not, the resulting output may contain incorrect or unexpected values.

Output Example:
Assuming inputs with shape [2*3, 4, 5] (representing 2 batches of 3 players each, with 4 provinces and a representation size of 5) and gather array with shape [2*3, 4], the output will be a jnp.ndarray with shape [2*3, 5]. Each row in this output corresponds to the aggregated representation of the selected province for each player in the batch.
***
### FunctionDef _relational_core(self, previous_orders, board_representation, is_training)
_relational_core: The function of _relational_core is to apply a relational core to the current province's board representation and previous decisions.

parameters:
· previous_orders: jnp.ndarray - A tensor representing the previous orders made, with shape [B*PLAYERS, NUM_PROVINCES, 2 * self._filter_size].
· board_representation: The current state of the board, which is a tensor that includes information about the provinces.
· is_training: bool - A flag indicating whether the function is being called during training (default is False).

Code Description:
The _relational_core function processes the input data by first concatenating the previous orders and the current board representation along the last axis. This combined input is then passed through an encoding step using the self._encode method, which transforms the concatenated inputs into a higher-level representation. The function iteratively applies each core in self._cores to this representation, adding the output of each core back to the representation (residual connection). After all cores have been applied, the final representation is normalized using batch normalization (self._bn) before being returned.

In the context of the project, _relational_core is called within the __call__ method of the RelationalOrderDecoder class. This method constructs representations of previous orders and board states, which are then passed to _relational_core to generate a refined representation that considers both the current state and historical actions. The output from _relational_core is used to compute order logits for each province, which are further processed to eliminate illegal actions before sampling an action index.

Note: Ensure that the inputs provided to _relational_core match the expected shapes and types to avoid runtime errors. The function assumes that self._encode, self._cores, and self._bn are properly initialized and configured.

Output Example:
A possible output of _relational_core could be a tensor with shape [B*PLAYERS, NUM_PROVINCES, 2 * self._filter_size], representing the refined board representation after incorporating previous orders and applying the relational core transformations.

### FunctionDef initial_state(self, batch_size, dtype)
**initial_state**: The function of initial_state is to initialize the state required by the RelationalOrderDecoder at the start of an order generation process.

parameters: 
· batch_size: An integer representing the number of sequences or samples processed together.
· dtype: A numpy data type indicating the desired data type for the arrays in the returned state. It defaults to jnp.float32 if not specified.

Code Description: The initial_state function is designed to create an instance of RelationalOrderDecoderState with all attributes initialized to zero values. This setup serves as a starting point for the order generation process, ensuring that there are no residual states from previous computations. The function takes two parameters: batch_size and dtype. The batch_size parameter determines the number of sequences or samples processed simultaneously, which is crucial for handling multiple instances in parallel. The dtype parameter allows specifying the data type of the arrays within the state, with jnp.float32 being the default choice.

The function constructs a RelationalOrderDecoderState object by initializing three key attributes:
- prev_orders: A jnp.ndarray filled with zeros, representing the previous orders made. Its shape is determined by batch_size, utils.NUM_PROVINCES, and 2 * self._filter_size.
- blocked_provinces: Another jnp.ndarray filled with zeros, indicating which provinces are currently blocked from taking actions. This array's shape is defined by batch_size and utils.NUM_PROVINCES.
- sampled_action_index: A jnp.ndarray containing the index of the last sampled action, initialized to zero for all entries. Its shape corresponds to batch_size.

These initializations ensure that the RelationalOrderDecoder begins its operation with a clean state, ready to process new data without any pre-existing information influencing the results.

Note: When using the initial_state function, it is important to provide an appropriate batch_size and optionally specify the dtype if a different data type is required. The shapes of the arrays within the returned RelationalOrderDecoderState must match those expected by other methods in the RelationalOrderDecoder class to ensure proper functionality during the order generation process.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
RelationalOrderDecoderState(
    prev_orders=jnp.array([[[0., 0., ..., 0.], [0., 0., ..., 0.], ..., [0., 0., ..., 0.]],
                           [[0., 0., ..., 0.], [0., 0., ..., 0.], ..., [0., 0., ..., 0.]],
                           ...,
                           [[0., 0., ..., 0.], [0., 0., ..., 0.], ..., [0., 0., ..., 0.]]]),
    blocked_provinces=jnp.array([[0., 0., ..., 0.],
                                 [0., 0., ..., 0.],
                                 ...,
                                 [0., 0., ..., 0.]]),
    sampled_action_index=jnp.array([0, 0, ..., 0])
)
***
## FunctionDef ordered_provinces(actions)
**ordered_provinces**: The function of ordered_provinces is to extract province information from action codes.
parameters: 
· actions: jnp.ndarray - An array containing encoded actions where each element represents an action with embedded province information.

Code Description: The ordered_provinces function processes the input 'actions' array by performing bitwise operations. It first right-shifts the elements of the 'actions' array by a predefined number of bits (ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_START) to align the province information in the least significant bits. Then, it applies a bitwise AND operation with a mask that has ones in the positions corresponding to the number of bits used for representing provinces (ACTION_PROVINCE_BITS). This effectively isolates and returns only the province part of each action code.

In the context of the project, this function is called within the __call__ method of the RelationalOrderDecoder class. Specifically, it is used to determine which province an action pertains to after a previous action has been decoded. The extracted province information is then one-hot encoded and added to the representation of previous orders in the graph structure. This step is crucial for constructing the order logits that represent the likelihood of different actions being issued based on the current state of the board and previous decisions.

Note: Ensure that the 'actions' array contains valid action codes with embedded province information as expected by the function. The correctness of the output depends on the proper encoding of actions according to the project's specifications.

Output Example: If the input 'actions' array is [1024, 2048], and assuming ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_START is 10 and ACTION_PROVINCE_BITS is 5, the function would return an array [1, 2] indicating that the actions pertain to provinces 1 and 2 respectively.
## FunctionDef is_waive(actions)
**is_waive**: The function of is_waive is to determine if a given action corresponds to the "waive" action based on bitwise operations.

parameters: 
· actions: A jnp.ndarray representing the actions taken, where each element encodes multiple pieces of information about an action through bit manipulation.

Code Description: 
The is_waive function checks whether the specified actions include the "waive" action. It performs this check by first right-shifting the 'actions' array by a predefined number of bits (ACTION_ORDER_START) to isolate the part of the action code that represents the order or type of action. Then, it applies a bitwise AND operation with a mask ((1 << ACTION_ORDER_BITS) - 1), which is designed to extract only the relevant bits corresponding to the action type. Finally, it compares this extracted value to a constant (action_utils.WAIVE) using jnp.equal to determine if the action is indeed a "waive" action.

The function returns an array of boolean values where each element corresponds to whether the respective action in the input 'actions' array is a "waive" action or not. This result is used by other parts of the code, such as the blocked_provinces_and_actions function, to filter out actions that are considered illegal when they involve waiving.

In the context of the project, the is_waive function plays a crucial role in determining which actions can be legally taken based on previous game state decisions. Specifically, it is used within the blocked_provinces_and_actions function to ensure that provinces and actions marked as "waive" are not incorrectly flagged as illegal when they should be permissible.

Note: The 'actions' parameter must be a jnp.ndarray where each element encodes multiple action attributes through bitwise manipulation according to predefined bit positions and sizes. Misalignment with these expectations can lead to incorrect results.

Output Example: 
If the input actions array is [waive_action_code, non_waive_action_code], the output would be [True, False] indicating that only the first action corresponds to a "waive" action.
## FunctionDef loss_from_logits(logits, actions, discounts)
**loss_from_logits**: The function of loss_from_logits is to compute either cross-entropy loss or entropy based on whether actions are provided.

parameters: 
· logits: Logits from the model output, representing unnormalized log probabilities.
· actions: Actions taken by the agent; if None, the function computes entropy instead of cross-entropy loss.
· discounts: Discount factors applied to the loss for adequate players.

Code Description: The function calculates either the cross-entropy loss or entropy depending on whether actions are provided. If actions are not None, it computes the cross-entropy loss by first extracting the log probabilities corresponding to the taken actions using `jax.nn.log_softmax` and `jnp.take_along_axis`. It then applies a mask to consider only the actual actions (where actions > 0). If actions are None, it calculates the entropy of the logits by multiplying the softmax probabilities with their negative log values and summing over the last axis. The loss is further aggregated by summing over the third dimension and applying discounts for adequate players before returning the mean of the resulting loss.

The function is utilized in the `loss_info` method within the same module, where it computes both policy loss (cross-entropy) and policy entropy based on the logits from the model's output. The computed losses are then used to update the network's policy given a batch of experience.

Note: Ensure that the logits, actions, and discounts have compatible shapes for operations like `jnp.take_along_axis` and element-wise multiplication.

Output Example: A scalar value representing the mean loss after applying all computations and reductions. For instance, if the computed losses are [0.5, 1.2, 0.8] and there are three adequate players, the output could be approximately 0.833 (mean of [0.5, 1.2, 0.8]).
## FunctionDef ordered_provinces_one_hot(actions, dtype)
**ordered_provinces_one_hot**: The function of ordered_provinces_one_hot is to generate a one-hot encoded representation of provinces based on actions, with specific conditions applied.

parameters: 
· actions: A jnp.ndarray representing the actions taken in the game or simulation.
· dtype: The data type for the output array, defaulting to jnp.float32.

Code Description: The function ordered_provinces_one_hot first creates a one-hot encoded representation of provinces using the action_utils.ordered_province function and the total number of provinces (utils.NUM_PROVINCES). This encoding is then multiplied by a mask that ensures only actions greater than 0 and not marked as waived are considered valid. The mask is created by converting boolean conditions to the specified dtype, ensuring alignment with the one-hot encoded provinces array.

In the context of its callers in the project:
- In blocked_provinces_and_actions, ordered_provinces_one_hot is used to update the blocked provinces based on previous actions. This helps in determining which provinces are illegal for future actions.
- In reorder_actions, ordered_provinces_one_hot aids in reordering actions according to area ordering by aligning action provinces with the specified areas and seasons.

Note: The function assumes that certain utility functions (like those from action_utils) and constants (like utils.NUM_PROVINCES) are correctly defined elsewhere in the project. It is crucial that these dependencies are properly set up for the function to work as intended.

Output Example: If actions = [1, 0, 2] and there are 5 provinces, with dtype=jnp.float32, the output could be a one-hot encoded array where only the provinces corresponding to actions greater than 0 (and not waived) are marked. For instance:
[[0., 1., 0., 0., 0.],
 [0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
 [0., 0., 0., 1., 0.]]
## FunctionDef reorder_actions(actions, areas, season)
**reorder_actions**: The function of reorder_actions is to reorder actions based on area ordering, adjusting for specific conditions related to provinces and seasons.

**parameters**: 
· actions: A jnp.ndarray representing the actions taken in the game or simulation.
· areas: A jnp.ndarray indicating the areas associated with each action.
· season: A jnp.ndarray specifying the current season, which influences how actions are reordered.

**Code Description**: The function reorder_actions begins by creating a one-hot encoded representation of provinces for each area using jax.nn.one_hot. This encoding is then used to map areas to their respective provinces. The function ordered_provinces_one_hot is called to generate a one-hot encoded representation of provinces based on the actions, considering only valid actions (greater than 0 and not waived). These encodings are combined with the province mappings to reorder the actions according to the specified area ordering.

The reordering process involves summing the product of actions, their corresponding province encodings, and the area-province mappings. This results in a reordered set of actions that aligns with the intended area sequence. The function also calculates the number of valid actions found for each area-season combination and adjusts the reordered actions accordingly to account for missing actions (represented by -1).

A special condition is applied when the season indicates a build phase, where no reordering occurs, and the original actions are retained. This is achieved using a boolean mask that skips reordering during the build phase.

**Note**: The function assumes that certain utility functions (like those from action_utils) and constants (like utils.NUM_PROVINCES and utils.Season.BUILDS.value) are correctly defined elsewhere in the project. It is crucial that these dependencies are properly set up for the function to work as intended.

In the context of its callers in the project, reorder_actions is used within the loss_info method of the Network class to prepare actions for teacher forcing during policy training. The reordered actions ensure that they match with the legal action ordering required by the network's inference process.

**Output Example**: If actions = [[[1, 0], [2, -1]], [[-1, 3], [4, 5]]], areas = [[[0, 1], [1, 0]], [[1, 0], [0, 1]]], and season = [[0], [1]], the output could be a reordered set of actions that align with the area ordering. For instance:
[[[1, -1], [2, 0]],
 [[-1, 4], [3, 5]]]
This example assumes specific mappings between areas and provinces as well as valid action conditions. The actual output will depend on the detailed mappings and conditions defined in the project's utility functions and constants.

### FunctionDef initial_inference_params_and_state(cls, constructor_kwargs, rng, num_players)
**initial_inference_params_and_state**: The function of initial_inference_params_and_state is to initialize the parameters and state required for network inference.

parameters: 
· cls: This parameter represents the class itself, which should have methods like `inference` and `get_observation_transformer`.
· constructor_kwargs: A dictionary containing keyword arguments needed to instantiate the network class.
· rng: A random number generator key used for initializing the network parameters.
· num_players: An integer specifying the number of players, which is used to generate a zeroed-out observation.

Code Description: The function defines an inner function `_inference` that creates an instance of the network using `constructor_kwargs` and calls its `inference` method with provided observations. This inner function is then transformed into a Haiku (hk) function with state using `hk.transform_with_state`. The parameters and network state are initialized by calling the transformed function's `init` method, which takes the random number generator key (`rng`) and a zeroed-out observation generated by the `get_observation_transformer` method. The zeroed-out observation is expanded to match the expected input format using `tree_utils.tree_expand_dims`.

In the context of the project, `initial_inference_params_and_state` plays a crucial role in setting up the initial state for network inference processes. It leverages the `get_observation_transformer` method to generate an appropriate zeroed-out observation that matches the required input dimensions based on the number of players.

Note: The function assumes that the class passed as `cls` has methods `inference` and `get_observation_transformer`. Additionally, it relies on the Haiku library for transforming functions with state and tree_utils for manipulating nested data structures.

Output Example: A tuple containing the initialized parameters and network state.
```
(params=<HaikuParams object>, net_state=<HaikuState object>)
```
#### FunctionDef _inference(observations)
_inference: The function of _inference is to create an instance of the network and perform inference using the given observations.

parameters:
· observations: A tuple containing initial observation data, step observations, and sequence lengths.

Code Description: The _inference function initializes a new instance of the network class using the constructor keyword arguments. It then calls the `inference` method on this network instance, passing in the provided observations. This method is designed to compute value estimates and actions for the full turn based on the input data.

The process begins by creating an instance of the network with specified constructor arguments. The `network.inference(observations)` call triggers a series of operations within the network's inference method:
1. It processes initial observations to generate outputs and a shared representation.
2. For each player, it initializes inference states using the shared representation and player-specific tensors.
3. These initial states are then stacked along the player dimension.
4. The step observations, sequence lengths, and initial inference states are prepared as inputs for further processing.
5. If specified by `num_copies_each_observation`, these inputs are replicated to produce multiple samples per state without recalculating the deterministic part of the network.
6. For each player, the function applies an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) to process the step observations and generate outputs based on the initial states.
7. The outputs from the RNN are then processed to align with the expected format.

The relationship between _inference and its callees in the project is that _inference serves as a high-level interface for performing inference tasks. It leverages the network's `inference` method, which encapsulates the detailed logic for processing observations and generating value estimates and actions.

Note: Ensure that the constructor keyword arguments (`constructor_kwargs`) are correctly defined to instantiate the network class properly. The format of the input observations must match the expected structure by the network's inference method.

Output Example: A tuple containing initial outputs and processed outputs from the RNN, structured as follows:
(initial_outputs, outputs)
Where `initial_outputs` is a dictionary of jnp.ndarray objects representing value estimates and actions for the initial state, and `outputs` is a dictionary of jnp.ndarray objects representing value estimates and actions for each step in the sequence.

### FunctionDef get_observation_transformer(cls, class_constructor_kwargs, rng_key)
**get_observation_transformer**: The function of get_observation_transformer is to return an instance of GeneralObservationTransformer.

parameters: 
· class_constructor_kwargs: This parameter is intended to hold constructor arguments for the class, but it is not used within the function.
· rng_key: An optional parameter that represents a random number generator key. It is passed to the GeneralObservationTransformer during its instantiation.

Code Description: The get_observation_transformer function is designed to instantiate and return an object of type GeneralObservationTransformer. Despite accepting class_constructor_kwargs as a parameter, this argument is immediately deleted within the function body, indicating that it does not influence the creation or behavior of the returned transformer. If provided, rng_key is utilized during the initialization of the GeneralObservationTransformer.

In the context of the project, get_observation_transformer plays a crucial role in preparing observation transformers for use in network inference processes. It is invoked by both initial_inference_params_and_state and zero_observation methods within the Network class. Specifically, in initial_inference_params_and_state, it aids in setting up the initial parameters and state of the network by generating a zeroed-out observation that matches the expected input format. Similarly, in zero_observation, it is used to produce an observation filled with zeros for a specified number of players, which can be useful for initializing or resetting states.

Note: The class_constructor_kwargs parameter is not utilized within this function and can be omitted when calling get_observation_transformer. However, rng_key should be provided if randomization is required during the transformer's initialization.

Output Example: An instance of GeneralObservationTransformer, potentially initialized with a specific rng_key if provided. For example:
```
<observation_transformation.GeneralObservationTransformer object at 0x7f8b4c3a2d50>
```
***
### FunctionDef zero_observation(cls, class_constructor_kwargs, num_players)
**zero_observation**: The function of zero_observation is to return an observation filled with zeros for a specified number of players by utilizing an instance of GeneralObservationTransformer.

parameters: 
· class_constructor_kwargs: This parameter is intended to hold constructor arguments for the class, but it is not used within the function.
· num_players: An integer specifying the number of players for which the zeroed observation is generated.

Code Description: The zero_observation function is designed to generate an observation that consists entirely of zeros for a given number of players. It achieves this by first calling the get_observation_transformer method with class_constructor_kwargs, which returns an instance of GeneralObservationTransformer. Despite class_constructor_kwargs being passed as a parameter, it is not utilized within the get_observation_transformer function and can be omitted when calling zero_observation. The returned transformer then has its zero_observation method invoked with num_players to produce the desired output.

In the context of the project, zero_observation plays a role in initializing or resetting states by providing a standardized zeroed observation for a specified number of players. This is particularly useful in scenarios where network inference processes require an initial state that matches the expected input format but does not contain any meaningful data.

Note: The class_constructor_kwargs parameter is not utilized within this function and can be omitted when calling zero_observation.

Output Example: An observation array filled with zeros for the specified number of players. For example, if num_players is 2, the output might look like:
```
[[0., 0., 0., ...], [0., 0., 0., ...]]
```
***
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the Network class with specified parameters for constructing and configuring various components such as RNNs, board encoders, and MLPs.

parameters: 
· rnn_ctor: Constructor for the RNN. The RNN will be constructed as `rnn_ctor(batch_norm_config=batch_norm_config, **rnn_kwargs)`.
· rnn_kwargs: kwargs for the RNN.
· name: a name for this module.
· num_players: number of players in the game, usually 7 (standard Diplomacy) or 2 (1v1 Diplomacy).
· area_mdf: path to mdf file containing a description of the board organized by area (e.g. Spain, Spain North Coast and Spain South Coast).
· province_mdf: path to mdf file containing a description of the board organized by province (e.g. Spain).
· is_training: whether this is a training instance.
· shared_filter_size: filter size in BoardEncoder, shared (across players) layers.
· player_filter_size: filter size in BoardEncoder, player specific layers.
· num_shared_cores: depth of BoardEncoder, shared (across players) layers.
· num_player_cores: depth of BoardEncoder, player specific layers.
· value_mlp_hidden_layer_sizes: sizes for value head. Output layer with size num_players is appended by this module.
· actions_since_last_moves_embedding_size: embedding size for last moves actions.
· batch_norm_config: kwargs for batch norm, eg the cross_replica_axis.

Code Description: The __init__ method initializes an instance of the Network class. It sets up several key components based on the provided parameters:
- **Adjacency Matrices**: Using the `area_mdf` and `province_mdf`, it computes symmetric normalized Laplacian adjacency matrices for areas and provinces, respectively. These matrices are used in the BoardEncoder to facilitate message passing between different regions of the board.
- **BoardEncoders**: Two instances of BoardEncoder are created: one for encoding the current state of the board (`_board_encoder`) and another for encoding the last moves actions (`_last_moves_encoder`). Both encoders use the computed adjacency matrices, along with parameters such as `shared_filter_size`, `player_filter_size`, `num_shared_cores`, and `num_player_cores` to configure their internal layers.
- **Embeddings**: An embedding layer is created for encoding the actions since the last moves. The size of this embedding is determined by `actions_since_last_moves_embedding_size`.
- **RNN**: An RNN is instantiated using the provided constructor (`rnn_ctor`) and keyword arguments (`rnn_kwargs`). This RNN will process sequences of encoded board states.
- **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)**: A value head MLP is constructed with hidden layer sizes specified by `value_mlp_hidden_layer_sizes`. An additional output layer with size equal to the number of players is appended to this MLP, which is used for predicting values associated with different player actions.

Note: The __init__ method ensures that all necessary components are properly initialized and configured according to the provided parameters. It sets up the network architecture in a way that allows it to process board states, encode last moves, and make predictions about player actions using an RNN and MLP. Proper configuration of these components is crucial for the overall functionality and performance of the Network class.

### FunctionDef loss(self, step_types, rewards, discounts, observations, step_outputs)
**loss**: The function of loss is to compute the imitation learning loss by utilizing detailed information from another method called `loss_info`.

parameters:
· step_types: tensor of step types with shape [B,T+1].
· rewards: tensor of rewards with shape [B,T+1].
· discounts: tensor of discounts with shape [B,T+1].
· observations: observations in format given by observation_transform, which is a tuple (initial_observation, step_observations, num_actions) with batch dimensions [B,T+1].
· step_outputs: tensor of network outputs produced by inference with batch dimensions [B, T].

Code Description: The `loss` function calculates the imitation learning loss for updating the network's policy based on a batch of experience. It achieves this by calling the `loss_info` method, which computes various losses and metrics such as policy loss, value loss, entropy, accuracy, and more. The `loss` function specifically extracts the "total_loss" from the dictionary returned by `loss_info` and returns it.

The relationship with its callees in the project is that `loss` relies on `loss_info` to perform detailed calculations of different components of the loss. By calling `loss_info`, `loss` ensures that all necessary computations are performed before extracting and returning the total loss value.

Note: Ensure that the inputs provided to this function match the expected shapes and formats, as mismatches can lead to errors in computation.

Output Example: The output is a single scalar value representing the total loss. For example:
123.456
***
### FunctionDef shared_rep(self, initial_observation)
**shared_rep**: The function of shared_rep is to process initial observations by encoding board state, season, and previous moves, and to compute value head information.

parameters: 
· initial_observation: A dictionary containing the initial observation data including board state, season, build numbers, and last moves phase board state. This parameter aligns with the specification defined in `initial_observation_spec`.

Code Description: The function shared_rep takes an initial observation as input, which includes various components of the game state such as the current board state, the current season, the number of builds, and the board state from the last moves phase. It first extracts these components from the input dictionary. Then, it encodes recent actions taken since the last moves phase using a predefined encoder method `_moves_actions_encoder` and concatenates this information with the last moves data.

Next, the function computes two representations: one for the current board state (`board_representation`) and another for the last moves (`last_moves_representation`). Both of these representations are generated by passing the respective data through their corresponding encoders (`_board_encoder` and `_last_moves_encoder`), along with additional context such as the season and build numbers. These two representations are then concatenated to form a comprehensive area representation.

Finally, the function computes value head information using a multi-layer perceptron (`_value_mlp`) applied to the mean of the area representation across players and areas. The output includes both the raw logits from the value MLP and their softmax-transformed values, which represent the estimated value of the current game state.

Note: This function is crucial for preparing shared representations that are used in subsequent inference steps, as demonstrated by its call within the `inference` method. It ensures that all units requiring an order have access to a consistent and comprehensive representation of the game state.

Output Example: 
```python
({
    'value_logits': array([-0.12345679,  0.23456789], dtype=float32),
    'values': array([0.4750208 , 0.5249792 ], dtype=float32)
}, 
array([[[[ 0.12345679, -0.23456789],
          [ 0.34567891, -0.45678901]],
         [[-0.56789012,  0.67890123],
          [-0.78901234,  0.89012345]]]])
)
```
***
### FunctionDef initial_inference(self, shared_rep, player)
**initial_inference**: The function of initial_inference is to set up the initial state required to implement inter-unit dependence.

parameters: 
· shared_rep: A jnp.ndarray representing the shared representation across different units.
· player: A jnp.ndarray indicating the player index for which the inference is being initialized.

Code Description: The initial_inference function takes two parameters, shared_rep and player. It first determines the batch size from the shape of shared_rep. Then, it uses jax.vmap combined with functools.partial to apply jnp.take along axis 0 to each element in shared_rep based on the values specified in player after squeezing player's second dimension. This operation essentially selects specific rows from shared_rep according to the indices provided by player. The function then returns a tuple containing these selected representations and the initial state of an RNN, which is generated by calling self._rnn.initial_state with the determined batch size.

The function plays a crucial role in preparing the necessary initial states for each player before the main inference process begins. This setup allows the model to handle inter-unit dependencies effectively by providing tailored initial states based on the shared representations and player-specific indices. The results from this function are utilized within the inference method, where they are stacked along a new axis to form a structure suitable for further processing in the RNN.

Note: Ensure that the dimensions of shared_rep and player match appropriately to avoid errors during the jnp.take operation. Also, the batch size should be consistent across all operations involving shared_rep and player to maintain data integrity.

Output Example: 
A possible output of this function could be:
((array([[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4]]), array([[0.5, 0.6], [0.7, 0.8]])), initial_rnn_state)
where the first element is a tuple containing two arrays of selected representations for each player, and the second element is the initial state of the RNN.
***
### FunctionDef step_inference(self, step_observation, inference_internal_state, all_teacher_forcing)
**step_inference**: The function of step_inference is to compute logits for one unit that requires order, using the current observation and internal state.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· step_observation: A dictionary containing observations necessary for inference, such as areas, legal actions mask, last action, and temperature. This should align with the structure defined in `step_observation_spec`.
· inference_internal_state: A tuple consisting of the board representation for each player and the previous state of the RelationalOrderDecoder.
· all_teacher_forcing: A boolean flag indicating whether to use teacher forcing during inference, which can speed up learning by providing ground truth actions.

**Code Description**: The `step_inference` function processes a single step's observation and internal state to generate action logits. It begins by computing an average area representation from the current observations and existing board representations. This average is then used along with other elements of the observation (legal actions mask, teacher forcing flags, last action, and temperature) to construct an input object for the recurrent neural network.

The constructed `RecurrentOrderNetworkInput` object is passed to the RNN (`self._rnn`) to generate logits and update the internal state. The logits are transformed into a policy using softmax, and a legal action mask is created to filter out illegal actions. Actions are sampled from the updated internal state, and if `all_teacher_forcing` is set to True, the sampled action indices in the internal state are reset to zero.

The function returns an ordered dictionary containing the computed actions, legal action masks, policy, and logits, along with the updated internal state for subsequent steps. This process is integral to the inference mechanism of the network, particularly within the `apply_one_step` method of the `inference/_apply_rnn_one_player` module, where it handles individual player observations and updates their respective states.

**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code
Ensure that the `step_observation` dictionary is correctly formatted according to the expected structure. The `inference_internal_state` should be a valid tuple containing the board representation and RNN state. Properly setting the `all_teacher_forcing` flag can significantly impact the learning process during training.

**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
```
{
  'actions': array([1, 2, 3]),
  'legal_action_mask': array([[ True, False,  True],
                             [False,  True,  True],
                             [ True,  True, False]]),
  'policy': array([[0.2, 0.1, 0.7],
                   [0.4, 0.5, 0.1],
                   [0.3, 0.6, 0.1]]),
  'logits': array([[-0.8, -1.9,  1.2],
                    [-0.5,  0.7, -1.4],
                    [-0.9,  0.8, -1.3]])

This documentation provides a clear and precise overview of the `DataProcessor` class, detailing its methods, parameters, and usage.
#### FunctionDef _apply_rnn_one_player(player_step_observations, player_sequence_length, player_initial_state)
**_apply_rnn_one_player**: The function of _apply_rnn_one_player is to process observations for one player using an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) model, considering sequence lengths and initial states.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· player_step_observations: A structured array containing observations for each step in the sequence for a batch of players. Its shape is [B, 17, ...], where B is the batch size and 17 represents the number of steps or timesteps.
· player_sequence_length: An array indicating the actual length of sequences for each player in the batch. Its shape is [B].
· player_initial_state: The initial state of the RNN for each player in the batch. Its shape is [B].

**Code Description**: The description of this Function.
The function begins by converting all elements within `player_step_observations` to JAX numpy arrays using `tree.map_structure`. It then defines an inner function, `apply_one_step`, which takes a state and an index `i` as inputs. This function applies the RNN step operation (`self.step_inference`) on the i-th slice of observations for all players in the batch, along with the current state.

The `update` function is defined within `apply_one_step` to conditionally update the state based on whether the current index `i` exceeds the sequence length for each player. If `i` is greater than or equal to the sequence length for a particular player, the state remains unchanged; otherwise, it is updated with `next_state`. This ensures that the RNN does not process beyond the actual data length for any player.

The output from `self.step_inference` is also conditionally updated using the same logic. If `i` exceeds the sequence length, the output is set to zero; otherwise, it retains the computed value. The function then returns the updated state and output.

The `hk.scan` function is used to apply `apply_one_step` across all timesteps (up to a maximum defined by `action_utils.MAX_ORDERS`) for each player in the batch. This results in a tuple containing the final state and accumulated outputs over time. The outputs are then transposed using `swapaxes` to align with the expected output format, where the first dimension represents players and the second dimension represents timesteps.

**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code
Ensure that `player_step_observations`, `player_sequence_length`, and `player_initial_state` are correctly shaped as specified. The function assumes that `self.step_inference` is a method available in the class, which processes one step of the RNN given observations, state, and an optional teacher forcing flag (`all_teacher_forcing`). The maximum number of orders (`action_utils.MAX_ORDERS`) should be set appropriately to cover all possible timesteps.

**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Assuming `B=2` (batch size of 2), and each player has observations for up to 17 steps, with sequence lengths of 10 and 15 respectively, the output would be a structured array where each element is transposed from its original shape. For instance, if the RNN outputs are scalars, the final output might look like:
```
[
    [output_1_t1, output_1_t2, ..., output_1_t10, 0, 0, ..., 0],  # Player 1
    [output_2_t1, output_2_t2, ..., output_2_t15, 0, 0, ..., 0]   # Player 2
]
```
where `output_i_tj` represents the RNN output for player `i` at timestep `j`, and zeros are padding for timesteps beyond each player's sequence length.
##### FunctionDef apply_one_step(state, i)
**apply_one_step**: The function of apply_one_step is to process one step of inference for a single player by updating the state based on observations and returning the updated state along with the output.

parameters: 
· state: A tuple consisting of the board representation for each player and the previous state of the RelationalOrderDecoder.
· i: An integer representing the current index in the sequence of observations to be processed.

Code Description: The apply_one_step function handles the inference process for a single step in the sequence of player actions. It begins by extracting the relevant observation at the current index `i` from `player_step_observations` using `tree.map_structure`. This extracted observation, along with the current state and the flag `all_teacher_forcing`, is passed to the `step_inference` method.

The `step_inference` method computes logits for one unit that requires order based on the provided observations and internal state. It returns an ordered dictionary containing action information such as actions, legal action masks, policy, and logits, along with the updated internal state. The output from `step_inference` includes `output`, which contains the computed action information, and `next_state`, representing the updated internal state.

The function then defines a nested function `update` that updates elements of the current state only if the current index `i` is less than the player's sequence length. This is achieved using `jnp.where`. The `state` variable is updated by applying this `update` function across all structures in the state using `tree.map_structure`.

A zero output structure, `zero_output`, is created with the same shape as `output` using `jnp.zeros_like`. Another application of `tree.map_structure` with the `update` function updates `zero_output` based on the computed `output`. The final result includes the updated state and the updated output.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
Ensure that the `player_step_observations` dictionary is correctly formatted according to the expected structure. The `state` should be a valid tuple containing the board representation and RNN state. Properly setting the `all_teacher_forcing` flag can significantly impact the learning process during training.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
```

  }

· x: An array representing the current state or value.
· y: An array representing the new state or value that may replace x under certain conditions.
· i: An integer index used for comparison with the player sequence length. It defaults to a predefined variable i if not explicitly provided.

Code Description: The function update utilizes JAX's jnp.where method, which is similar to a conditional statement in Python but operates on arrays. The condition checked is whether the index i is greater than or equal to the corresponding value in player_sequence_length for each element in the batch (assuming x and y are batched). If this condition holds true for an element, the function returns the original value from x at that position; otherwise, it returns the new value from y. The slicing operation np.s_[:,] + (None,) * (x.ndim - 1) is used to broadcast player_sequence_length across dimensions of x and y appropriately.

Note: Ensure that the shapes of x, y, and player_sequence_length are compatible for broadcasting during the comparison. Also, be aware of the default value of i if it's not explicitly passed when calling the function.

Output Example: If x = jnp.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]]), y = jnp.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]]), player_sequence_length = jnp.array([0, 1]), and i = 1, then the output will be jnp.array([[5, 6], [3, 4]]) because for the first element in the batch (i=0 < player_sequence_length[0]=0 is False), y is chosen; for the second element (i=1 >= player_sequence_length[1]=1 is True), x is chosen.
