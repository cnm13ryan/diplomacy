## FunctionDef normalize_adjacency(adjacency)
**normalize_adjacency**: The function of normalize_adjacency is to compute the symmetric normalized Laplacian of an adjacency matrix.
**parameters**: 
· adjacency: A 2D NumPy array representing the adjacency matrix without self-connections.

**Code Description**: This function computes the symmetric normalized Laplacian, which is a key step in spectral graph theory and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). The process involves several steps:
1. **Self-Connection Addition**: The adjacency matrix is incremented by an identity matrix to ensure every node has self-connection.
2. **Degree Matrix Calculation**: A diagonal matrix \( D \) is created where each element \( D_{ii} \) is the square root of the sum of elements in row \( i \) (or column \( i \)) of the adjacency matrix, which represents the degree of vertex \( i \).
3. **Symmetric Normalization**: The Laplacian matrix \( L \) is computed as \( D^{-\frac{1}{2}} A D^{-\frac{1}{2}} \), where \( A \) is the adjusted adjacency matrix.

This normalized Laplacian matrix is crucial for various graph-related tasks, such as node classification and clustering in Graph Convolutional Networks. It ensures that each node's influence is balanced according to its degree, leading to better performance in graph-based machine learning models.

In the context of the `Network` class within the project, this function is called twice during initialization:
- To generate the area adjacency matrix for the board organized by areas.
- To generate the province adjacency matrix for the board organized by provinces.

These matrices are then used as input parameters for the `BoardEncoder` and other components that process graph-related data. The normalized Laplacian matrices help in understanding the structural properties of the game board, which is essential for making informed decisions in the game of Diplomacy or similar strategic games.

**Note**: Ensure that the adjacency matrix provided to this function does not contain self-connections as it will be added internally. Also, the input matrix should be symmetric and non-negative, representing valid graph connections.

**Output Example**: The output is a 2D NumPy array representing the symmetric normalized Laplacian matrix of the given adjacency matrix. For example, if the input adjacency matrix \( A \) is:
```
[[0, 1, 0],
 [1, 0, 1],
 [0, 1, 0]]
```
The output might be something like:
```
[[0.5774, -0.3333,  0   ],
 [-0.3333,  0.8165, -0.5  ],
 [0   , -0.5,  0.5774]]
```
## ClassDef EncoderCore
**EncoderCore**: The function of EncoderCore is to perform one round of message passing on node representations using graph convolutional operations.

**attributes**:
· adjacency: [NUM_AREAS, NUM_AREAS] symmetric normalized Laplacian of the adjacency matrix.
· filter_size: output size of per-node linear layer.
· batch_norm_config: config dict for hk.BatchNorm.
· name: a name for the module.

**Code Description**: The `EncoderCore` class is designed to facilitate message passing in graph networks, particularly where each node's representation is updated based on its neighborhood. It takes as input a normalized Laplacian matrix representing the network topology and performs one round of message passing using linear transformations and batch normalization. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization (`__init__` method)**:
   - The constructor initializes several key attributes, including `adjacency`, which represents the graph's structure.
   - It sets up the `filter_size`, which determines the dimensionality of the transformed node features.
   - A `batch_norm_config` is provided to customize batch normalization parameters if needed.
   - An optional `name` parameter allows for naming the module.

2. **Message Passing (`__call__` method)**:
   - The core functionality lies in the implementation of a single round of message passing, where each node's feature vector is updated based on its neighbors' features and the adjacency matrix.
   - This involves linear transformations to project the input features into a higher-dimensional space followed by batch normalization and activation functions (though not explicitly shown here).

3. **Batch Normalization**:
   - The `hk.BatchNorm` module is used for normalizing the transformed feature vectors, which helps in stabilizing the learning process and improving generalization.

4. **Relationship with Callers**:
   - `EncoderCore` is a fundamental component utilized by other classes such as `RelationalOrderDecoder`. In these contexts, it acts as an encapsulated building block that performs localized transformations on node features.
   - Specifically, in the `RelationalOrderDecoder`, multiple instances of `EncoderCore` are sequentially applied to refine and update node representations over several rounds.

**Note**: Ensure that the `adjacency` matrix is appropriately normalized before passing it to the constructor. The choice of `filter_size` should be carefully considered based on the desired complexity of feature extraction.

**Output Example**: Given an input node representation tensor, the output after a single round of message passing will have the same shape as the input but with updated features that reflect the influence of neighboring nodes according to the provided adjacency matrix. For example, if the input is a 10x256 tensor (10 nodes each with 256 features), the output might be a 10x512 tensor after applying the `EncoderCore` operations.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, adjacency)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the EncoderCore module.
**parameters**: 
· adjacency: [NUM_AREAS, NUM_AREAS] symmetric normalized Laplacian of the adjacency matrix.
· filter_size: output size of per-node linear layer.
· batch_norm_config: config dict for hk.BatchNorm. Default value is None.
· name: a name for the module. Default value is "encoder_core".
**Code Description**: The `__init__` method serves as the constructor for the EncoderCore class, setting up its internal state and configurations based on the provided parameters.

The method begins by calling the superclass's `__init__` method with the specified `name`, ensuring that any necessary initialization from the parent class is performed. This step is crucial for maintaining consistency across different classes in a potential hierarchy or framework.

Next, the adjacency matrix (`self._adjacency`) and filter size (`self._filter_size`) are stored as instance variables. These values will be used throughout the module to define the structure of the encoder core, specifically how node features are processed based on the graph's topology.

A batch normalization configuration dictionary (`bnc`) is initialized with default values, including a decay rate for exponential moving averages and epsilon to avoid division by zero. The `batch_norm_config` parameter allows users to override these defaults if necessary. This configuration is then updated using the provided `batch_norm_config` (if any) before creating an instance of `hk.BatchNorm` (`self._bn`). Batch normalization helps in stabilizing and accelerating training, especially for deep networks.

**Note**: Ensure that the adjacency matrix passed as the `adjacency` parameter is symmetric and normalized. The filter size should be appropriately chosen based on the desired output dimensionality. Users can customize batch normalization behavior through the `batch_norm_config` parameter to fine-tune performance according to their specific needs.
***
### FunctionDef __call__(self, tensors)
**__call__**: The function of __call__ is to perform one round of message passing within the EncoderCore.
**Parameters**:
· tensors: jnp.ndarray with shape [B, NUM_AREAS, REP_SIZE], representing the input node representations.
· is_training: bool, default value False, indicating whether this call is during training.

**Code Description**: 
The __call__ method in the EncoderCore class implements a single round of message passing. It takes as input a tensor `tensors` and an optional boolean flag `is_training`. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Weight Initialization and Message Calculation**:
   ```python
   w = hk.get_parameter(
       "w", shape=tensors.shape[-2:] + (self._filter_size,),
       init=hk.initializers.VarianceScaling())
   messages = jnp.einsum("bni,nij->bnj", tensors, w)
   ```
   - A weight matrix `w` is initialized using the `hk.get_parameter` function. The shape of `w` is derived from the last two dimensions of `tensors`, followed by the filter size `_filter_size`.
   - The `messages` are calculated via a batched matrix multiplication, where each node's representation in `tensors` is multiplied with the weight matrix `w`.

2. **Message Propagation and Aggregation**:
   ```python
   tensors = jnp.matmul(self._adjacency, messages)
   ```
   - The adjacency matrix `_adjacency` is used to propagate the calculated messages across nodes.

3. **Combining Incoming Messages and Outgoing Messages**:
   ```python
   tensors = jnp.concatenate([tensors, messages], axis=-1)
   ```
   - The updated node representations `tensors` are concatenated with the original incoming messages `messages`, along the last dimension to capture both incoming and outgoing information.

4. **Batch Normalization**:
   ```python
   tensors = self._bn(tensors, is_training=is_training)
   ```
   - Batch normalization `_bn` is applied to the combined node representations based on whether it's in training mode or not.

5. **Activation Function Application**:
   ```python
   return jax.nn.relu(tensors)
   ```
   - The ReLU activation function is applied to the normalized tensors, producing the final output.

**Note**: Ensure that the adjacency matrix `_adjacency` and batch normalization layer `_bn` are properly defined within the class for this method to work correctly. Also, pay attention to the shape of `tensors` and ensure it matches the expected dimensions throughout the operations.

**Output Example**: The return value is a jnp.ndarray with shape [B, NUM_AREAS, 2 * self._filter_size], where each node's representation now includes both its aggregated incoming messages and outgoing messages. For instance:
```python
output = encoder_core(tensors)
print(output.shape)  # Output: (batch_size, num_areas, 2 * filter_size)
```

This output can then be used as input for the next round of message passing in subsequent layers or sub-networks within a larger graph neural network architecture.

### FunctionDef __call__(self, state_representation, season, build_numbers, is_training)
**__call__**: The function of __call__ is to encode the board state based on given inputs.
**parameters**:
· state_representation: [B, NUM_AREAS, REP_SIZE] - A tensor representing the state of each area on the board for B batches.
· season: [B, 1] - A tensor indicating the current season for each batch.
· build_numbers: [B, 1] - A tensor containing the number of builds for each batch.
· is_training: bool = False (default) - A boolean flag to indicate whether this call is during training.

**Code Description**: The function __call__ performs the following steps:

1. **Season Context Embedding and Replication**:
   ```python
   season_context = jnp.tile(
       self._season_embedding(season)[:, None], (1, utils.NUM_AREAS, 1))
   ```
   This step embeds the season information using a pre-defined embedding layer (`_season_embedding`) and replicates it across all areas for each batch.

2. **Build Numbers Replication**:
   ```python
   build_numbers = jnp.tile(build_numbers[:, None].astype(jnp.float32),
                            (1, utils.NUM_AREAS, 1))
   ```
   The build numbers are replicated to match the dimensions of the state representation and casted to float for numerical operations.

3. **Concatenation**:
   ```python
   state_representation = jnp.concatenate(
       [state_representation, season_context, build_numbers], axis=-1)
   ```
   These two tensors (season context and build numbers) are concatenated with the original state representation along the last dimension to enrich the input features.

4. **Shared Encoding Layer**:
   ```python
   representation = self._shared_encode(
       state_representation, is_training=is_training)
   for layer in self._shared_core:
     representation += layer(representation, is_training=is_training)
   ```
   The concatenated tensor goes through a shared encoding process using `_shared_encode`, followed by multiple layers in `_shared_core` that refine the representation.

5. **Player Context Embedding and Replication**:
   ```python
   player_context = jnp.tile(
       self._player_embedding.embeddings[None, :, None, :],
       (season.shape[0], 1, utils.NUM_AREAS, 1))
   ```
   Player context embeddings are replicated to match the batch size and area dimensions.

6. **Tile and Concatenate**:
   ```python
   representation = jnp.tile(representation[:, None],
                             (1, self._num_players, 1, 1))
   representation = jnp.concatenate([representation, player_context], axis=3)
   ```
   The representation is tiled to match the number of players and concatenated with the player context embeddings along a new dimension.

7. **Player-Specific Encoding**:
   ```python
   representation = hk.BatchApply(self._player_encode)(
       representation, is_training=is_training)
   for layer in self._player_core:
     representation += hk.BatchApply(layer)(
         representation, is_training=is_training)
   ```
   The tiled and concatenated tensor undergoes player-specific encoding using `_player_encode` and additional layers in `_player_core`.

8. **Batch Normalization**:
   ```python
   return self._bn(representation, is_training=is_training)
   ```
   Finally, batch normalization is applied to the representation before returning it.

**Note**: Ensure that all embedding layers (`_season_embedding`, `_player_embedding`) and core layers (`_shared_core`, `_player_core`) are properly initialized and configured. The function assumes the presence of the necessary hyperparameters such as `NUM_AREAS` and `_num_players`.

**Output Example**: The output is a tensor with shape `[B, NUM_AREAS, 2 * self._player_filter_size]`, which represents the encoded board state considering both shared and player-specific contexts.
***
## ClassDef RecurrentOrderNetworkInput
**RecurrentOrderNetworkInput**: The function of RecurrentOrderNetworkInput is to encapsulate the necessary inputs required by the recurrent order network during its operation.

**attributes**:
· average_area_representation: A tensor representing the average area representation, with dimensions [B*PLAYERS, REP_SIZE].
· legal_actions_mask: A mask indicating which actions are legal for each player, with dimensions [B*PLAYERS, MAX_ACTION_INDEX].
· teacher_forcing: A boolean tensor indicating whether teacher forcing is applied, with dimensions [B*PLAYERS].
· previous_teacher_forcing_action: The action taken during the last step of teacher forcing if it was applied, with dimensions [B*PLAYERS].
· temperature: A scalar or vector representing the temperature parameter used for sampling actions, with dimensions [B*PLAYERS, 1].

**Code Description**: RecurrentOrderNetworkInput is a NamedTuple that serves as an input structure for the recurrent order network. This tuple encapsulates several key pieces of information necessary to make decisions at each step during the operation of the network.

The named tuple includes:
- `average_area_representation`: This tensor provides contextual information about areas on the board, which helps in making informed decisions.
- `legal_actions_mask`: A binary mask that indicates whether an action is legal for a given player and area. This ensures that only valid actions are considered during decision-making.
- `teacher_forcing`: A boolean indicating whether teacher forcing is applied, where the network follows the previous step's action instead of sampling from the policy distribution.
- `previous_teacher_forcing_action`: The actual action taken in the last step when teacher forcing was active. This helps maintain consistency and continuity in the decision-making process.
- `temperature`: A scalar or vector that controls the randomness of the actions selected by the network. Higher temperatures lead to more exploration, while lower temperatures favor exploitation.

The RecurrentOrderNetworkInput is utilized in two key functions within the project:
1. **In `_rnn` (Recurrent Neural Network) Function**: This function uses the input tuple to process and make decisions based on the current state of the board and previous actions.
2. **In `step_observation_spec` Function**: Here, it constructs the input for the recurrent order network from a set of observations and internal states, ensuring that the network receives all necessary information at each step.

By encapsulating these inputs in a structured manner, RecurrentOrderNetworkInput facilitates clear and organized data handling, making it easier to manage and process during the decision-making process. This structure ensures that the network has access to relevant and up-to-date information required for its operation.

**Note**: Ensure that all input tensors have the correct shape and type before passing them into the named tuple. Incorrect shapes or types can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior in the network's operations. Additionally, when using teacher forcing, ensure that the `previous_teacher_forcing_action` is correctly set according to the previous step's action.
## FunctionDef previous_action_from_teacher_or_sample(teacher_forcing, previous_teacher_forcing_action, previous_sampled_action_index)
**previous_action_from_teacher_or_sample**: The function of previous_action_from_teacher_or_sample is to determine the previous action based on either teacher forcing or sampling from possible actions.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: `teacher_forcing` - A jnp.ndarray indicating whether teacher forcing should be used. This is a boolean array where True means using teacher forcing, and False means sampling from possible actions.
· parameter2: `previous_teacher_forcing_action` - A jnp.ndarray containing the action taken during previous steps when teacher forcing was active.
· parameter3: `previous_sampled_action_index` - A jnp.ndarray representing the index of the sampled action from the set of possible actions.

**Code Description**: The function `previous_action_from_teacher_or_sample` decides which action to use based on a condition defined by the `teacher_forcing` array. If `teacher_forcing` is True at a particular index, it returns the corresponding value from `previous_teacher_forcing_action`. Otherwise, it selects an action from the set of possible actions using the index provided in `previous_sampled_action_index`.

The function uses NumPy's `where` method to conditionally select between these two options. The `action_utils.shrink_actions(action_utils.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS)` call ensures that only valid actions are considered when sampling, and `jnp.asarray(...)[previous_sampled_action_index]` retrieves the specific action based on the index.

This function is called within the `__call__` method of `RelationalOrderDecoder`, which is responsible for issuing an order based on board representation and previous decisions. The `teacher_forcing` array, `previous_teacher_forcing_action`, and `previous_sampled_action_index` are passed from this context to decide the previous action.

**Note**: Ensure that the input arrays (`teacher_forcing`, `previous_teacher_forcing_action`, and `previous_sampled_action_index`) have compatible shapes. The `teacher_forcing` array should be broadcastable with the other two arrays for correct operation.

**Output Example**: If `teacher_forcing` is `[True, False]`, `previous_teacher_forcing_action` is `[10, 20]`, and `previous_sampled_action_index` is `[5, 7]`, then the function will return `[10, 7]`. This means that for the first element, since `teacher_forcing` is True, it returns `10`; for the second element, since `teacher_forcing` is False, it samples from the possible actions and returns index `7`.
## FunctionDef one_hot_provinces_for_all_actions
**one_hot_provinces_for_all_actions**: The function one_hot_provinces_for_all_actions is responsible for generating one-hot encoded representations of all possible provinces.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: The `one_hot_provinces_for_all_actions` function returns a one-hot encoded array representing all the possible provinces in the game. It uses JAX's `jax.nn.one_hot` function to create this encoding, where each province is represented by an array of zeros with a single one at its index position. This encoding is crucial for various operations that require distinguishing between different provinces.

The function starts by converting the list of all possible actions into an ordered sequence of provinces using `action_utils.ordered_province`. It then converts these provinces into a NumPy array (`jnp.asarray`) and passes this array to `jax.nn.one_hot`, which creates a one-hot encoded matrix where each row corresponds to a province. The number of columns in the resulting matrix is equal to the total number of possible provinces, as specified by `utils.NUM_PROVINCES`.

This function is called within the `blocked_provinces_and_actions` method and also indirectly through the `RelationalOrderDecoder.__call__` method. In both contexts, it provides a standardized way to represent all provinces in one-hot format, which is essential for various computations involving legal actions and blocked provinces.

**Note**: Ensure that `utils.NUM_PROVINCES` and related constants are correctly defined elsewhere in your codebase to avoid runtime errors.
**Output Example**: The function returns a tensor of shape `(num_provinces, num_provinces)`, where each row represents a province with one element set to 1 and all others set to 0. For instance, if there are 5 provinces, the output might look like:

```
[[1., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
 [0., 1., 0., 0., 0.],
 [0., 0., 1., 0., 0.],
 [0., 0., 0., 1., 0.],
 [0., 0., 0., 0., 1.]]
```

## FunctionDef sample_from_logits(logits, legal_action_mask, temperature)
**sample_from_logits**: The function of `sample_from_logits` is to sample actions from logits while respecting a legal action mask.
**parameters**: 
· `logits`: A jnp.ndarray representing the raw prediction scores before applying any temperature or masking, with shape [B*PLAYERS, MAX_ACTION_INDEX].
· `legal_action_mask`: A jnp.ndarray indicating which actions are legal for each player and province, with shape [B*PLAYERS, MAX_ACTION_INDEX]. Legal actions are marked as True (1) and illegal ones as False (0).
· `temperature`: A jnp.ndarray controlling the randomness of sampling. Higher values make the action selection more stochastic.

**Code Description**: 
The function `sample_from_logits` is designed to handle both deterministic and stochastic sampling based on the provided temperature value, ensuring that only legal actions are considered for selection. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Deterministic Sampling (temperature = 0)**:
   - The logits are first transformed into a deterministic form by setting all non-max action indices to negative infinity.
   - This ensures that the highest score (determined by `argmax`) is selected, making the sampling process deterministic.

2. **Stochastic Sampling (temperature > 0)**:
   - For legal actions, the logits are divided by the temperature value, effectively adjusting their relative scores based on the temperature parameter.
   - Illegal actions have their logits set to negative infinity, ensuring they are never chosen during sampling.

3. **Combining Deterministic and Stochastic Logits**:
   - The function then combines these two sets of logits using a mask that identifies whether the current temperature is zero or not.
   - If the temperature is 0, it uses the deterministic logits; otherwise, it uses the stochastic logits.

4. **Sampling Action**:
   - A new random key is generated to ensure reproducibility and randomness in sampling.
   - The `jax.random.categorical` function is used to sample actions based on the combined logits, with the axis set to `-1` to select one action per player per province.

5. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns a sampled action index for each player-province pair as a jnp.ndarray of shape [B*PLAYERS].

This function is crucial in ensuring that actions are selected based on both deterministic and stochastic criteria, while respecting the legal action constraints provided by `legal_action_mask`.

**Note**: Ensure that the input logits are correctly shaped and compatible with the expected dimensions. The temperature parameter should be appropriately set to control the level of randomness in action selection.

**Output Example**: 
Given inputs where `logits` = [[10, 2, 3], [5, 8, 9]], `legal_action_mask` = [[True, False, True], [False, True, True]], and `temperature` = 0.5 (stochastic), the function might return a sampled action index such as `[2, 1]`, indicating that in the first province, action with score 3 is selected, and in the second province, action with score 8 is chosen.
## ClassDef RelationalOrderDecoderState
**RelationalOrderDecoderState**: The function of RelationalOrderDecoderState is to maintain the state information required by the RelationalOrderDecoder during its operation.

**attributes**:
- prev_orders: A jnp.ndarray representing the previous orders made, with shape [B*PLAYERS, NUM_PROVINCES, 2 * _filter_size]. This array holds the historical context of player actions.
- blocked_provinces: A jnp.ndarray indicating which provinces are currently blocked by previous actions, with shape [B*PLAYERS, NUM_PROVINCES]. Each element is a boolean value representing whether a province is blocked or not.
- sampled_action_index: A jnp.ndarray storing the index of the action that has been sampled for each player, with shape [B*PLAYERS].

**Code Description**: The RelationalOrderDecoderState class is used to encapsulate the state information necessary for the RelationalOrderDecoder during its operation. This includes maintaining a record of previous orders (`prev_orders`), tracking which provinces are blocked by these orders (`blocked_provinces`), and storing the index of the most recently sampled action (`sampled_action_index`). 

This class is crucial in ensuring that the decoder can make informed decisions based on the context provided by past actions. The `__call__` method of RelationalOrderDecoder uses this state to update the blocked provinces, construct a representation of previous orders, and generate logits for potential new actions. Specifically, it processes the average area representation, legal action masks, and teacher forcing signals to produce logits that are then used to sample the next action.

The `initial_state` method initializes the RelationalOrderDecoderState with zeros, setting up the initial state where no previous orders have been made, all provinces are unblocked, and there is no sampled action yet. This initialization ensures that the decoder starts from a clean slate each time it processes new inputs.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the batch size (`batch_size`) matches the number of players in the game when calling `initial_state`. Additionally, the data types used for arrays should be consistent with the rest of the system to avoid runtime errors.
## ClassDef RelationalOrderDecoder
**RelationalOrderDecoder**: The function of RelationalOrderDecoder is to output order logits for a unit based on the current board representation and orders selected for other units so far.

**Attributes**:
- `adjacency`: A [NUM_PROVINCES, NUM_PROVINCES] symmetric normalized Laplacian of the per-province adjacency matrix.
- `filter_size`: The filter size used in relational cores.
- `num_cores`: The number of relational cores to be used.
- `projection`: A parameter used for projecting province representations into logits.

**Code Description**: 
1. **Initialization and Parameters**: The class is initialized with the adjacency matrix, filter size, and number of cores. It also initializes a projection parameter which maps province representations into logits.

2. **Initial State**: The method `initial_state` returns an initial state object containing zero-filled arrays for previous orders, blocked provinces, and sampled action indices. This state is used to start the order generation process.

3. **Order Generation Process**:
   - **Scattered Representations**: The method `_scatter_to_province` is used to place province representations into appropriate slots in the graph by scattering them according to legal actions.
   - **Previous Orders Representation**: Similarly, previous orders are represented and placed in their respective slots using one-hot encoding.
   - **Core Logic**: The `relational_core` function processes these scattered representations to generate a board representation that captures interactions between provinces. This is done through a series of operations including matrix multiplications and scatter operations.
   - **Order Logits Calculation**: Province representations are gathered from the board representation, and then transformed into logits using a projection matrix. These logits represent potential orders for each province.
   - **Legal Actions Handling**: The logits are adjusted to eliminate illegal actions based on the legal actions mask provided by the input.

4. **Action Sampling**: A sampled action index is derived from the logits using temperature-based sampling, ensuring that higher probability actions have a greater chance of being selected.

5. **State Update**: The method returns updated state objects containing the new previous orders, blocked provinces status, and the sampled action index.

**Note**: Users must ensure that the input parameters such as `average_area_representation`, `legal_actions_mask`, and `teacher_forcing` are properly configured for accurate order generation. Additionally, the adjacency matrix should accurately reflect the connectivity between provinces to ensure meaningful interactions in the model.

**Output Example**: The method returns logits with shape `[B*PLAYERS, MAX_ACTION_INDEX]` representing potential orders for each player, along with an updated state object containing information about previous orders, blocked provinces, and the sampled action index.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, adjacency)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the RelationalOrderDecoder module.
**parameters**: 
· adjacency: [NUM_PROVINCES, NUM_PROVINCES] symmetric normalized Laplacian of the per-province adjacency matrix.
· filter_size: filter size for relational cores (default value is 32).
· num_cores: number of relational cores (default value is 4).
· batch_norm_config: configuration dictionary for hk.BatchNorm (optional).
· name: module's name (default value is "relational_order_decoder").

**Code Description**: The `__init__` method initializes the RelationalOrderDecoder class, setting up its internal components based on the provided parameters. Here’s a detailed breakdown of what happens during initialization:

1. **Superclass Initialization**: 
   - The `super().__init__(name=name)` call ensures that any necessary superclass initializations are performed, such as setting the module name.

2. **Instance Variables Assignment**:
   - `_filter_size` is assigned the value of the provided `filter_size`.
   - An instance variable `_encode` is created and initialized with an instance of the `EncoderCore` class, which processes tensors based on the adjacency matrix and filter size.
   
3. **Relational Core Initialization**: 
   - A list `_encodes` is created to hold multiple instances of `EncoderCore`. The number of these instances depends on the value of `num_cores`.
   - For each core in `_encodes`, an instance of `EncoderCore` is initialized with the provided adjacency matrix, filter size, and batch normalization configuration. This setup allows for a series of transformation steps through different cores.

4. **Batch Normalization Setup**: 
   - A `hk.BatchNorm` object is created and stored in `_bn`. The parameters for batch normalization are set based on the default values or those provided via `batch_norm_config`.

**Relationship with Callees**: 
- The `__init__` method sets up the internal structure of the RelationalOrderDecoder. It prepares it to handle data by initializing necessary components and configurations.
- The `EncoderCore` instances within `_encodes` are crucial as they perform specific transformation steps on input tensors, contributing to the overall functionality of the decoder.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the adjacency matrix provided is correctly formatted and normalized for proper operation.
- Adjusting the `filter_size` and `num_cores` can significantly impact the model's performance and complexity. Carefully consider these parameters based on your specific use case.
- The batch normalization configuration should be tailored to fit the data distribution, which can affect training stability and accuracy.
***
### FunctionDef _scatter_to_province(self, vector, scatter)
**_scatter_to_province**: The function of _scatter_to_province is to scatter vectors into their corresponding province locations based on one-hot encoded scatter masks.
**Parameters**:
· vector: A jnp.ndarray with shape [B*PLAYERS, REP_SIZE], representing the input vectors that need to be scattered.
· scatter: A jnp.ndarray with shape [B*PLAYER, NUM_PROVINCES], a one-hot encoding indicating the province locations for each player.

**Code Description**: The function `_scatter_to_province` is responsible for placing the input vector into its corresponding provinces as specified by the `scatter` mask. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Parameters**:
   - `vector`: This represents the vectors that need to be scattered, with shape `[B*PLAYERS, REP_SIZE]`. Each row corresponds to a player and their representation in some feature space.
   - `scatter`: A one-hot encoding indicating which province each player's vector should be placed into. The mask has shape `[B*PLAYER, NUM_PROVINCES]`, where `NUM_PROVINCES` is the number of provinces available.

2. **Operation**:
   - For each player (indicated by the first dimension of the `vector`), the function uses the corresponding row in the `scatter` mask to determine which province's representation should be updated.
   - The operation `vector[:, None, :] * scatter[..., None]` broadcasts the vector across the provinces and then multiplies it with the one-hot encoding. This results in a tensor where each vector is placed into its designated province.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns a tensor of shape `[B*PLAYERS, NUM_AREAS, REP_SIZE]`, where `NUM_AREAS` corresponds to the number of provinces (or areas). Each player's vector has been inserted into its corresponding province location as specified by the scatter mask.

4. **Usage in Context**:
   - `_scatter_to_province` is called within the `__call__` method of the `RelationalOrderDecoder`. It plays a crucial role in integrating the current state of the game (represented by `inputs.average_area_representation`) with the previous orders (`prev_state.prev_orders`). Specifically, it ensures that the representations are correctly placed into their respective provinces based on the legal actions and previous decisions.

**Note**: Ensure that the input vectors and scatter masks are properly aligned to avoid incorrect placements. The function assumes that both inputs have the correct dimensions for broadcasting operations.

**Output Example**: Suppose we have 2 players, each with a representation vector of size 32 (REP_SIZE = 32), and there are 5 provinces (NUM_PROVINCES = 5). If `vector` is:
```
[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
 [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]
```
And the scatter mask is:
```
[[1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]]
```
The output would be:
```
[[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]],
 [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]]]
```
This output places the first player's vector in province 1 and the second player's vector in province 2, with all other provinces initialized to zero vectors.
***
### FunctionDef _gather_province(self, inputs, gather)
**_gather_province**: The function of _gather_province is to gather specific province location representations from inputs based on one-hot encoding.

**Parameters**:
· `inputs`: A 3D array with shape `[B*PLAYERS, NUM_PROVINCES, REP_SIZE]`, where `B` represents the batch size, `PLAYERS` indicates the number of players, and `REP_SIZE` is the representation size for each province.
· `gather`: A 2D one-hot encoding array with shape `[B*PLAYERS, NUM_PROVINCES]`, indicating which provinces to gather from the inputs.

**Code Description**: The function `_gather_province` performs element-wise multiplication between the `inputs` and `gather` arrays followed by summing along the province dimension. This operation effectively gathers representations of the selected provinces into a 2D array with shape `[B*PLAYERS, REP_SIZE]`.

In the context of the RelationalOrderDecoder class, `_gather_province` is used to extract relevant information from the board representation based on the legal actions mask (`legal_actions_provinces`). Specifically, it takes the board representation after processing by the relational core and selects only those parts corresponding to provinces that are still legal for action. This filtered representation is then used to generate logits for potential orders.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `inputs` and `gather` have compatible dimensions.
- The function assumes that `legal_actions_provinces` correctly identifies which actions are currently legal, as it uses this information to filter the board representation.

**Output Example**: Given an input array `inputs` of shape `[10*2, 50, 64]` and a one-hot encoding `gather` of shape `[10*2, 50]`, `_gather_province` returns an output array of shape `[10*2, 64]`. This output represents the gathered province representations for each player in the batch.
***
### FunctionDef _relational_core(self, previous_orders, board_representation, is_training)
**_relational_core**: The function of _relational_core is to apply relational core processing to current province representations and previous decisions.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `previous_orders` (jnp.ndarray) - A tensor containing previously made orders for each player, concatenated with the board representation.
· parameter2: `board_representation` - A tensor representing the state of the game board.
· parameter3: `is_training` (bool) - A flag indicating whether the model is in training mode. Default value is False.

**Code Description**: 
The `_relational_core` function takes into account both previous orders and the current state of the board, integrating them through a series of transformations to produce updated representations that are crucial for making decisions about future actions.

1. **Input Concatenation**: The function first concatenates `previous_orders` with `board_representation`, creating a combined input tensor.
2. **Encoding**: This combined input is then encoded using the `_encode` method, which processes it through an encoding network to generate a preliminary representation.
3. **Core Processing**: The resulting representation is iteratively processed by each core in the `_cores` list, where additional transformations are applied.
4. **Batch Normalization**: Finally, batch normalization is applied to the updated representation using the `_bn` method.

This function plays a critical role within the broader context of decision-making processes in the `RelationalOrderDecoder`. It integrates historical decisions and current board states to refine and update representations that are subsequently used for making informed choices about future actions. The function's output, after these transformations, is then utilized by higher-level functions such as `__call__` to generate logits for potential actions.

**Note**: Ensure that the input tensors (`previous_orders` and `board_representation`) have compatible dimensions and data types before passing them into this function. The `is_training` flag should be set appropriately based on whether the model is currently in training or inference mode, as this can affect certain operations like batch normalization.

**Output Example**: 
The output of `_relational_core` would be a tensor representing an updated state of knowledge about the game board and previous decisions, which could look something like:
```
jnp.array([[0.123456789, -0.234567890, ...],
           [0.246810123, -0.345678901, ...],
           ...
           [0.987654321, -0.876543210, ...]])
```
This tensor would be further processed to generate logits for potential actions in the game.

### FunctionDef initial_state(self, batch_size, dtype)
**initial_state**: The function of initial_state is to initialize the state information required by RelationalOrderDecoder at the beginning of each decoding process.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: batch_size (int) - The number of samples or players for which the initial state is being created.
· parameter2: dtype (np.dtype, default=jnp.float32) - The data type used for the arrays in the state. This ensures that all operations involving these arrays are performed with consistent precision.

**Code Description**: 
The `initial_state` method initializes a new instance of `RelationalOrderDecoderState`, which is essential for setting up the initial context before any decoding process begins. It creates three key components:
- **prev_orders**: A jnp.ndarray initialized to zeros, representing the historical actions taken by players. This array has a shape of (batch_size, utils.NUM_PROVINCES, 2 * self._filter_size), indicating that each player's previous orders are stored for every province and includes information up to a certain filter size.
- **blocked_provinces**: A jnp.ndarray also initialized to zeros, where each element is a boolean value. This array tracks which provinces have been blocked by the actions of players, helping to enforce constraints on future moves.
- **sampled_action_index**: A jnp.ndarray with shape (batch_size,), storing the index of the last sampled action for each player. Initially set to zero since no actions have been taken yet.

This initialization ensures that the decoder starts from a clean slate where there are no previous orders, all provinces are unblocked, and no action has been sampled. The `initial_state` method is crucial because it sets up the initial state required by the RelationalOrderDecoderState class to maintain and update the context during the decoding process.

**Note**: It's important that the provided `batch_size` matches the number of players in the game, as this affects how many states are initialized. Additionally, using a consistent data type (`dtype`) ensures compatibility with other parts of the system, preventing potential runtime errors.

**Output Example**: The output is an instance of `RelationalOrderDecoderState` with all fields initialized to zero arrays:
```
prev_orders: jnp.array([[0., 0., ..., 0., 0.],
                        [0., 0., ..., 0., 0.],
                        ...,
                        [0., 0., ..., 0., 0.]], dtype=float32)
blocked_provinces: jnp.array([[0, 0, ..., 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, ..., 0, 0],
                              ...,
                              [0, 0, ..., 0, 0]], dtype=float32)
sampled_action_index: jnp.array([0, 0, ..., 0], dtype=int32)
```
***
## FunctionDef ordered_provinces(actions)
**ordered_provinces**: The function of `ordered_provinces` is to extract the ordered provinces from an action array.
**parameters**: 
· actions: jnp.ndarray - An array representing the actions taken by players.

**Code Description**: The `ordered_provinces` function processes an array of actions and extracts the ordered provinces based on a specific bit manipulation technique. This function plays a crucial role in determining which provinces are currently being considered or ordered during the game, especially within the context of a sequential decision-making process like ordering provinces in a turn-based strategy game.

In detail, the function performs the following steps:
1. **Bitwise Shift and Masking**: The input `actions` array is right-shifted by `action_utils.ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_START`. This operation effectively isolates the bits representing ordered provinces from the full action space.
2. **Bitmask Operation**: A bitmask is created using `(1 << action_utils.ACTION_PROVINCE_BITS) - 1`, which generates a binary mask of length equal to `ACTION_PROVINCE_BITS` with all bits set to 1. This bitmask is then applied via the bitwise AND operation (`jnp.bitwise_and`) on the shifted actions array.
3. **Result**: The result is an array where each element represents the ordered province index for that action.

This function is called within the `__call__` method of the `RelationalOrderDecoder` class, which is responsible for generating order logits based on the current board state and previous actions. Specifically, it helps in determining which provinces are currently under consideration by players during their turn.

The `ordered_provinces` function ensures that only the relevant bits related to ordered provinces are extracted from the broader action space, making it easier to process and interpret these actions within the game logic.

**Note**: Ensure that the input array `actions` is correctly formatted and contains valid action indices. Incorrect or invalid inputs may lead to unexpected results.

**Output Example**: Given an input array of actions `[1024, 512, 768]`, where each value corresponds to a specific action index, the function might return `[3, 1, 2]` if `action_utils.ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_START = 10` and `action_utils.ACTION_PROVINCE_BITS = 3`. This output indicates that provinces with indices 3, 1, and 2 are currently ordered based on these actions.
## FunctionDef is_waive(actions)
**is_waive**: The function of is_waive is to determine whether actions are marked as "waive" based on their bit representation.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: actions (jnp.ndarray) - An array representing the actions, where each element's bits indicate specific action orders.

**Code Description**: 
The `is_waive` function takes an array of actions and checks if any of these actions are marked as "waived". It does this by performing a bitwise operation on the input actions. Specifically:
1. The function shifts the binary representation of each action to the right starting from a specified bit position (`action_utils.ACTION_ORDER_START`).
2. It then performs a bitwise AND with a mask that has `ACTION_ORDER_BITS` number of bits set to 1, effectively isolating these specific bits.
3. Finally, it compares the result using `jnp.equal` with a predefined value representing "waive" (from `action_utils.WAIVE`), returning an array of boolean values indicating whether each action is waived.

This function is crucial for determining which actions are considered waived in the broader context of decision-making processes within the network. It works alongside other functions like `blocked_provinces_and_actions`, where it helps filter out waived actions to ensure they do not contribute to illegal or invalid decisions.

**Note**: Ensure that the input array `actions` contains valid bit representations as defined by your system, and that `action_utils.WAIVE` is correctly set to represent a waive state. Any mismatch in these assumptions can lead to incorrect results.

**Output Example**: 
For example, if `actions = [0b101010, 0b000101]` (where each bit represents an action order), and `action_utils.WAIVE` is set to `0b000010`, the function might return `[False, True]`. This indicates that the second action in the array is marked as waived.
## FunctionDef loss_from_logits(logits, actions, discounts)
**loss_from_logits**: The function of `loss_from_logits` is to compute the cross-entropy loss based on logits and actions, or calculate entropy if no actions are provided.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: logits - A tensor representing the predicted action probabilities before applying softmax, with shape [B, T+1, N], where B is batch size, T+1 is sequence length (including initial state), and N is number of possible actions.
· parameter2: actions - An optional tensor representing the actual taken actions by the agent during training, with shape [B, T+1]. If `None`, entropy will be calculated instead of cross-entropy loss.
· parameter3: discounts - A tensor used to apply discounting over the sequence length, typically with shape [B, T+1].

**Code Description**: The function computes the loss or entropy based on the given logits and actions. Here is a detailed breakdown:
1. **Cross-Entropy Loss Calculation**: If `actions` are provided, the function calculates the cross-entropy loss between the predicted probabilities represented by `logits` and the actual `actions`. This is done using the formula for cross-entropy loss: 
   \[
   \text{loss} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \log(p_i)
   \]
   where \(y_i\) are one-hot encoded actions, and \(p_i\) are predicted probabilities from `logits`.

2. **Entropy Calculation**: If no `actions` are provided, the function calculates the entropy of the logits distribution:
   \[
   \text{entropy} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_i \log(p_i)
   \]
   This helps in measuring the uncertainty or randomness in the model's predictions.

3. **Legal Actions Masking**: The function ensures that only legal actions are considered by using a mask derived from `legal_actions_mask`, which is not explicitly shown but assumed to be part of the input context.

4. **Discounted Loss Calculation**: The loss or entropy values are optionally discounted over the sequence length, which can help in giving more importance to recent predictions compared to older ones.

5. **Broadcasting and Masking Operations**: The function handles broadcasting and masking operations to ensure that only relevant parts of the logits and actions contribute to the final loss calculation.

The relationship with its callers in the project is significant because `loss_from_logits` is used within the broader context of training a reinforcement learning model, specifically for calculating various types of losses and entropies. It directly supports the accuracy metrics computation by providing essential loss values that are then aggregated into more comprehensive measures like total loss, policy entropy, and uniform random agent comparison.

**Note**: Ensure that `actions` and `legal_actions_mask` are correctly provided to avoid errors in the loss calculation. The function assumes that `logits`, `actions`, and `discounts` have compatible shapes; otherwise, it will produce incorrect results.

**Output Example**: If called with valid inputs, the function could return a tensor representing the calculated loss or entropy value. For example:
- If `actions` are provided: A scalar tensor representing the cross-entropy loss.
- If no `actions` are provided: A scalar tensor representing the entropy of the logits distribution.
## FunctionDef ordered_provinces_one_hot(actions, dtype)
**ordered_provinces_one_hot**: The function of ordered_provinces_one_hot is to convert actions into one-hot encoded vectors based on their corresponding provinces.

**parameters**: 
· parameter1: actions - A jnp.ndarray representing the actions taken, where each action corresponds to a specific province.
· parameter2: dtype - A jnp.dtype specifying the data type for the output tensor (default is jnp.float32).

**Code Description**: 
The function `ordered_provinces_one_hot` first uses JAX's `one_hot` function to create a one-hot encoded vector for each action based on its province. This is done by passing `action_utils.ordered_province(actions)` as the indices and setting the depth of the one-hot encoding to `utils.NUM_PROVINCES`. The resulting tensor has shape `(batch_size, utils.NUM_PROVINCES)`, where each row corresponds to a single action.

Next, it applies a mask to this one-hot encoded vector. This mask is derived from the original actions array by checking which actions are greater than zero and not a 'waive' action (using `action_utils.is_waive(actions)`). The result of this check is broadcasted to match the shape of the one-hot encoded vector, and then multiplied element-wise with it.

The final output tensor has the same shape as the one-hot encoding but retains only those elements where the original actions were valid non-waive actions. This effectively filters out any invalid or waived actions from the one-hot encoding.

This function is called by `blocked_provinces_and_actions` to determine which provinces are blocked based on previous actions, and it also plays a role in reordering actions according to area ordering in the `reorder_actions` function.

**Note**: Ensure that the input actions are properly formatted as expected by this function. The dtype parameter should be chosen appropriately depending on the intended use of the output tensor.

**Output Example**: 
For example, if `actions = jnp.array([0, 3, 2])`, and assuming there are 5 provinces in total (`utils.NUM_PROVINCES == 5`), the function will return a tensor like:
```
[[0. 0. 0. 0. 0.] 
 [1. 0. 0. 1. 0.] 
 [0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]]
```
This output indicates that actions corresponding to provinces 3 and 2 are valid, while the action for province 0 is not considered due to it being a zero value (likely representing no action or a waiver).

### FunctionDef initial_inference_params_and_state(cls, constructor_kwargs, rng, num_players)
**initial_inference_params_and_state**: The function of initial_inference_params_and_state is to initialize parameters and states required for network inference.

**parameters**: 
· parameter1: cls - A reference to the class itself, used implicitly through inheritance.
· parameter2: constructor_kwargs - Keyword arguments for constructing the class, which are unused in this method but passed along.
· parameter3: rng - Random number generator key, used as a seed for deterministic transformations.
· parameter4: num_players - The number of players involved, which is necessary to initialize the observation transformer.

**Code Description**: 
The `initial_inference_params_and_state` function serves a critical role in setting up the initial parameters and states needed by the network during inference. Here’s how it works:

1. **Inference Function Definition**: A nested `_inference` function is defined, which takes observations as input. This function creates an instance of the class `cls` using the provided `constructor_kwargs`. Note that `not-instantiable` is disabled for `network`, meaning this step is a placeholder and does not actually instantiate the network.

2. **Transforming Function Initialization**: The `_inference` function is transformed into a function with state using `hk.transform_with_state`. This transformation allows the function to be initialized and run in a way that keeps track of internal states, which are essential for inference operations.

3. **State Initialization**: The initial parameters (`params`) and network state (`net_state`) are obtained by calling `inference_fn.init` with a random number generator key (`rng`). The observations used for initialization are generated using the zero observation method from the observation transformer configured in `constructor_kwargs`, expanded to match the number of players.

4. **Return Values**: The function returns the initialized parameters and network state, which can be used for further inference operations within the network.

The relationship with its callees is functional: `initial_inference_params_and_state` calls `get_observation_transformer` to ensure that an appropriate observation transformer is set up before initializing the network. This setup ensures that all observations are processed correctly according to the specified transformation rules, which is essential for the network's operation.

**Note**: Ensure that `rng_key` is appropriately provided or omitted based on the requirements of the specific use case. If no `rng_key` is passed, the function will still work but might produce non-deterministic behavior if such determinism is required.

**Output Example**: The output of this function would be a tuple containing two elements: 
- `params`: A set of parameters initialized for the network.
- `net_state`: The initial state of the network that can be used to start inference operations.

### FunctionDef get_observation_transformer(cls, class_constructor_kwargs, rng_key)
**get_observation_transformer**: The function of get_observation_transformer is to generate an observation transformer based on the given construction parameters.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: cls - A reference to the class itself, used implicitly through inheritance.
· parameter2: class_constructor_kwargs - Keyword arguments for constructing the class, which are unused in this method but passed along.
· parameter3: rng_key - Optional random number generator key, used as a seed for deterministic transformations.

**Code Description**: 
The `get_observation_transformer` function is designed to create an instance of `observation_transformation.GeneralObservationTransformer`. This transformer is crucial for processing observations in the network. The function takes keyword arguments intended for constructing the class (though it currently ignores these) and optionally a random number generator key (`rng_key`). If no `rng_key` is provided, the default value is used.

This method plays a significant role within the broader context of initializing parameters and states required by the network's inference process. Specifically, in the `initial_inference_params_and_state` function, it ensures that the observation transformer is correctly initialized before passing it to the network for state initialization.

The relationship with its callers is functional: `get_observation_transformer` is called within `initial_inference_params_and_state`, where it helps set up the necessary initial conditions for the network's inference operations by providing a properly configured observation transformer. This setup ensures that all observations are processed correctly according to the specified transformation rules, which is essential for the network's operation.

**Note**: Ensure that `rng_key` is appropriately provided or omitted based on the requirements of the specific use case. If no `rng_key` is passed, the function will still work but might produce non-deterministic behavior if such determinism is required.

**Output Example**: The output of this function is an instance of `observation_transformation.GeneralObservationTransformer`, which can then be used to transform observations in various parts of the network's operations. This transformer object would typically contain methods for transforming raw observations into a format suitable for processing by the neural network components.
***
### FunctionDef zero_observation(cls, class_constructor_kwargs, num_players)
**zero_observation**: The function of zero_observation is to generate an initial observation state where all values are set to zero.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: cls - A reference to the class itself, used implicitly through inheritance.
· parameter2: class_constructor_kwargs - Keyword arguments for constructing the class, which are unused in this method but passed along.
· parameter3: num_players - The number of players involved in the observation state.

**Code Description**: 
The `zero_observation` function is designed to create an initial observation state with all values set to zero. This function is highly dependent on the `get_observation_transformer` method, which generates an instance of `observation_transformation.GeneralObservationTransformer`. The `zero_observation` function then uses this transformer to produce a zero-filled observation state.

The `cls` parameter is passed as a reference to the class itself and is used implicitly through inheritance. This allows the method to be called on any subclass of the Network class without needing to explicitly pass the class type.

The `class_constructor_kwargs` parameter is included but not utilized within this function, serving more as a placeholder for any potential future use or consistency with other methods that might require such arguments.

The `num_players` parameter specifies the number of players in the game or scenario and determines the size of the zero-filled observation state. This value is crucial because it defines the dimensionality of the observation space.

In terms of functionality, this method plays a critical role in initializing states for the network's inference process. By generating an initial observation state where all values are set to zero, it ensures that the network can start processing observations from a neutral or baseline condition. This is particularly useful when setting up environments or scenarios where the starting point needs to be explicitly defined.

The `zero_observation` method is called by the broader context of initializing parameters and states required for the network's inference operations. Specifically, in the `initial_inference_params_and_state` function, it ensures that the observation transformer is correctly initialized before passing it to the network for state initialization. This setup guarantees that all observations are processed according to the specified transformation rules, which is essential for the network's operation.

**Note**: Ensure that `num_players` is appropriately provided based on the requirements of the specific use case. The function will work even if no value is passed, but it might produce unexpected results if the number of players significantly affects the observation state.

**Output Example**: The output of this function is a zero-filled array or tensor with dimensions corresponding to `num_players`. For example, if `num_players` is 4, the output could be `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, assuming the observation space is one-dimensional. If the observation space has multiple dimensions (e.g., for vector observations), the zero-filled state would reflect those dimensions accordingly.

### FunctionDef shared_rep(self, initial_observation)
**shared_rep**: The function of shared_rep is to process shared information that all units require before making decisions based on an initial observation.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: initial_observation (Dict[str, jnp.ndarray])
    - A dictionary containing the initial state information including "season", "build_numbers", "board_state", and "last_moves_phase_board_state".

**Code Description**: The shared_rep function processes the initial observation to prepare a shared board representation that will be used by various units in decision-making. Here is a detailed breakdown of its operations:

1. **Initialization and Extraction**:
    - Extracts key information from `initial_observation` such as "season", "build_numbers", "board_state", and "last_moves_phase_board_state".

2. **Encoding Last Moves**:
    - Computes the sum of actions taken since the last moves phase.
    - Concatenates these encoded actions with the existing last move representations.

3. **Board Representation Computation**:
    - Uses `_board_encoder` to compute a board representation based on "board_state", "season", and "build_numbers".
    - Similarly, uses `_last_moves_encoder` to encode the updated last moves.
    - Concatenates these two encodings along the channel dimension.

4. **Value Head Computation**:
    - Averages the concatenated board representation across players and areas.
    - Passes this averaged representation through a value MLP (`_value_mlp`) to compute value logits.
    - Applies softmax to obtain values from the logits.

5. **Return Values**:
    - Returns an ordered dictionary containing "value_logits" and "values", along with the shared board representation `area_representation`.

The function is called by the `inference` method, which processes observations for a full turn of decision-making in a game or simulation context. The `shared_rep` function ensures that all units share a consistent understanding of the current state before making their respective decisions.

**Note**: Ensure that `_board_encoder`, `_last_moves_encoder`, and `_value_mlp` are properly defined elsewhere in your codebase to avoid errors during execution. Additionally, make sure that the input observations are correctly formatted as per `initial_observation_spec`.

**Output Example**: The function returns a tuple where the first element is an ordered dictionary containing "value_logits" (a tensor of shape [B, NUM_PLAYERS]) and "values" (the softmax probabilities derived from logits), and the second element is the shared board representation `area_representation` (of shape [B, CHANNELS, HEIGHT, WIDTH]). Here, B represents the batch size, NUM_PLAYERS is the number of players in the game, and CHANNELS, HEIGHT, and WIDTH correspond to the dimensions of the encoded board state.
***
### FunctionDef initial_inference(self, shared_rep, player)
**initial_inference**: The function of initial_inference is to set up an initial state that implements inter-unit dependence.
**parameters**: 
· shared_rep: jnp.ndarray - A tensor representing the shared representation from the previous layer or step.
· player: jnp.ndarray - An array indicating which player's state we are initializing, used to select specific elements from `shared_rep`.

**Code Description**: The initial_inference function is a key component in setting up the initial state for implementing inter-unit dependence. It takes two inputs: `shared_rep`, which contains shared representations from the previous layer or step, and `player`, an index array that specifies which player's state we are initializing.

1. **Batch Size Calculation**: The function first determines the batch size by extracting it from the shape of `shared_rep`. This is crucial for ensuring that operations are performed across all examples in a batch.
2. **Vmap Application**: Using `jax.vmap`, it applies `jnp.take` along axis 0 to each element in `shared_rep` based on the corresponding index from `player.squeeze(1)`. This operation effectively selects specific elements from `shared_rep` for each player, creating an initial state that respects inter-unit dependence.
3. **RNN Initial State**: It also returns the initial state of the RNN (`self._rnn.initial_state(batch_size=batch_size)`), which is necessary for subsequent operations involving recurrent neural networks.

This function is called by `inference`, where it plays a critical role in setting up the initial inference states for each player. By returning both the selected elements from `shared_rep` and the RNN's initial state, it ensures that all players start with appropriate initial conditions for their respective computations.

**Note**: Ensure that `player` has the correct shape to match the batch size of `shared_rep`. Also, verify that `self._rnn.initial_state` is correctly implemented to handle the specified batch size.

**Output Example**: The function returns a tuple containing two elements:
1. A dictionary or array where each key/value pair corresponds to an initial state for a player.
2. The RNN's initial state with a shape of `[batch_size, ...]`, depending on the implementation of `self._rnn.initial_state`.

For example, if `shared_rep` has a shape of `(10, 512)` and `player` is an array of shape `(10, 1)`, the output might look like:
```
(
    {
        'player_0': jnp.array([...]),
        'player_1': jnp.array([...])
    },
    jnp.array([[0., 0., ...], [0., 0., ...]])
)
```
***
### FunctionDef step_inference(self, step_observation, inference_internal_state, all_teacher_forcing)
**step_inference**: The function of step_inference is to compute logits for one unit that requires order during inference.

**parameters**:
· step_observation: A dictionary containing observations relevant for the current step, including area representations and legal actions masks.
· inference_internal_state: Board representation for each player along with the previous state of the RelationalOrderDecoder.
· all_teacher_forcing: A boolean indicating whether to use teacher forcing (i.e., leaving sampled actions out of the inference state).

**Code Description**: The function step_inference plays a crucial role in the inference process by processing the current observation and internal state to produce logits for the next action. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Processing**: The function starts by extracting the area representation and the previous RNN state from `inference_internal_state`. It then calculates an average area representation by performing a matrix multiplication between the step observation's areas and the existing area representations.

2. **Input Construction**: Using the calculated average area representation, along with other relevant information such as legal actions masks, teacher forcing status, and temperature parameters, it constructs the input for the RNN using `RecurrentOrderNetworkInput`.

3. **RNN Application**: The constructed input is fed into the `_rnn` function to compute the next state and output logits. This process involves sequential processing of player observations and updating internal states.

4. **State Update**: After obtaining the new state from the RNN, the function updates the current state using a conditional update mechanism based on the sequence length of each player's actions. This ensures that the state is correctly updated for both normal inference steps and teacher forcing scenarios.

5. **Output Generation**: Finally, it generates zero outputs to replace the actual output when in a teacher forcing mode, ensuring consistency in the state updates.

This function is called by `apply_one_step`, which iterates over players and applies step_inference sequentially. This setup allows for handling multiple players' actions simultaneously during inference while maintaining the correct sequence of operations.

**Note**: Ensure that all input tensors have the correct shape and type before passing them into the named tuple. Incorrect shapes or types can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior in the network's operations, especially when using teacher forcing.

**Output Example**: The function returns a dictionary containing logits for the next action and an updated state dictionary. For instance:
```python
{
    'logits': jnp.ndarray(shape=(num_actions,), dtype=float),
    'state': {
        'area_representation': jnp.ndarray(shape=(hidden_size, num_players), dtype=float),
        'decoder_state': jnp.ndarray(shape=(decoder_hidden_size,), dtype=float)
    }
}
```
This output is used to determine the next action and update the internal state for further inference steps.

#### FunctionDef _apply_rnn_one_player(player_step_observations, player_sequence_length, player_initial_state)
**_apply_rnn_one_player**: The function of _apply_rnn_one_player is to process a sequence of observations for one player through a recurrent neural network (RNN) step by step.

**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `player_step_observations` - A tensor of shape [B, 17, ...] representing the observations at each time step for B players. The ellipsis indicates that there can be additional dimensions.
· parameter2: `player_sequence_length` - An array or list of integers of length B, indicating the actual sequence lengths for each player's observation sequence.
· parameter3: `player_initial_state` - A tensor representing the initial state of the RNN for B players.

**Code Description**:
1. **Observation Conversion**: The function first converts the `player_step_observations` using `tree.map_structure(jnp.asarray, ...)` to ensure that all elements are in a compatible numerical format.
2. **Step-wise Application**: A closure named `apply_one_step` is defined to process each time step of the sequence. This closure takes the current state and the index `i` as inputs.
3. **RNN Step Execution**: Inside the `apply_one_step` function, the RNN step inference (`self.step_inference`) is applied with a slice of `player_step_observations` at index `i`, combined with the current state. The parameter `all_teacher_forcing` ensures that teacher forcing is used if necessary.
4. **State Update**: A custom update function defined within `apply_one_step` uses `jnp.where` to conditionally update the RNN state based on whether the current time step index `i` exceeds the sequence length for each player.
5. **Zero Output Initialization**: For time steps beyond the actual sequence length, a zero output is generated using `tree.map_structure(jnp.zeros_like, ...)` and used to replace the original outputs.
6. **Scan Over Time Steps**: The `hk.scan` function iterates over all possible time steps (up to `action_utils.MAX_ORDERS`) applying the `apply_one_step` closure to each step while maintaining state across iterations.
7. **Output Reshaping**: Finally, the outputs are reshaped by swapping axes 0 and 1 using `tree.map_structure(lambda x: x.swapaxes(0, 1), outputs)` so that the sequence length dimension is moved from time steps to observations.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the `player_sequence_length` values do not exceed `action_utils.MAX_ORDERS`.
- The function assumes that the RNN model (`self.step_inference`) and other necessary modules are properly initialized.
- The use of teacher forcing can be controlled via the `all_teacher_forcing` parameter.

**Output Example**: 
The output is a tensor of shape [B, action_utils.MAX_ORDERS, ...] where each element in the sequence dimension corresponds to the processed outputs at that time step for each player.
##### FunctionDef apply_one_step(state, i)
**apply_one_step**: The function of apply_one_step is to update the state by applying one step of inference for each player during the game.

**parameters**:
· state: A dictionary containing the current state information for all players, including their board representations and previous states.
· i: An integer indicating the index of the current step in the sequence.

**Code Description**: The function apply_one_step sequentially processes the inference for each player by calling the step_inference method. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Step Inference Call**: The step_inference function is called with the relevant observations and state information sliced to focus on the current step `i`. This call processes the area representations, legal actions masks, and other necessary inputs to compute logits for the next action.

2. **State Update Mechanism**: After obtaining the output and updated state from step_inference, a conditional update mechanism is applied using the `update` function. The `update` function checks if the current index `i` exceeds the sequence length of each player's actions. If it does, the original state element is retained; otherwise, the new state element is used.

3. **Zero Output Generation**: Zero outputs are generated to replace the actual output when in a teacher forcing mode. This ensures that the state updates are consistent and do not include sampled actions during inference.

4. **Return Values**: The function returns an updated state dictionary and zero outputs for the current step, which can be used for further inference steps or action generation.

**Note**: Ensure that all input tensors have the correct shape and type before passing them into the named tuple. Incorrect shapes or types can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior in the network's operations, especially when using teacher forcing.

**Output Example**: The function returns an updated state dictionary and zero outputs for the current step:
```
{
    "player1_state": updated_player1_state,
    "player2_state": updated_player2_state,
    ...
},
zeros_output
```
###### FunctionDef update(x, y, i)
**update**: The function of update is to conditionally update elements in array `x` based on whether the index `i` has reached or exceeded the sequence length defined by `player_sequence_length`.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: x (jnp.ndarray)
    - Input array where updates will be applied.
· parameter2: y (jnp.ndarray)
    - Array containing values to apply in `x` if the condition is met.
· parameter3: i (int, optional)
    - Index value used for comparison. Default is `i=i`.

**Code Description**: 
The function `update` uses a conditional mechanism provided by `jnp.where` to selectively update elements of array `x`. The condition checks whether the index `i` has reached or exceeded the corresponding sequence length defined in `player_sequence_length`. If the condition is true, the element in `x` at that position is replaced with the corresponding value from `y`.

1. **jnp.where**: This function evaluates a boolean condition and returns elements chosen from either `x` or `y` based on the condition being True or False.
2. **i >= player_sequence_length[np.s_[:,] + (None,) * (x.ndim - 1)]**: 
   - `player_sequence_length` is an array that holds sequence lengths for each player.
   - The slice notation `np.s_[:,]` creates a slice object to select all elements in the first dimension of `player_sequence_length`.
   - `(None,) * (x.ndim - 1)` ensures that the broadcasted shape matches with `x`, making element-wise comparison possible between `i` and `player_sequence_length`.

3. **Return**: The function returns an updated array where values from `y` are inserted into `x` at positions where the condition is true.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the shapes of `x`, `y`, and `player_sequence_length` are compatible for broadcasting.
- The default value of `i=i` might be useful in scenarios where the function is called repeatedly with incrementing index values, but it should be explicitly set if used elsewhere.

**Output Example**: 
If `x = jnp.array([10, 20, 30])`, `y = jnp.array([5, 6, 7])`, and `player_sequence_length = np.array([2, 2, 3])` with `i=2`, the output will be:
```
jnp.array([10, 20, 7])
``` 
This is because for `i=2`, only the last element in both arrays matches (as per the sequence length condition), so it gets updated from `30` to `7`.
