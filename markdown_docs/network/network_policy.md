## ClassDef Policy
**Policy**: The function of Policy is to delegate stepping and updating actions to a network by handling observations, legal actions, and producing corresponding actions for specified slots.

attributes: The attributes of this Class.
· network_handler: An instance of network.network.NetworkHandler that manages the neural network operations.
· num_players: An integer representing the number of players in the game.
· temperature: A float value used as the policy sampling temperature, influencing the randomness of action selection.
· calculate_all_policies: A boolean indicating whether to compute policies for all players regardless of the slots_list argument provided to the actions method.
· _obs_transform_state: An internal state variable used to store the transformed observation state.
· _str: A string representation of the policy with its temperature value.

Code Description: The Policy class is designed to interact with a neural network through a NetworkHandler instance. It manages the transformation of observations and legal actions into actionable outputs for specified players in a game setting. Upon initialization, it sets up essential parameters including the number of players, sampling temperature, and whether all policies should be calculated. The reset method clears the internal observation state and resets the network handler. The actions method takes a list of slots (player indices), an observation from the environment, and legal actions for each player to produce corresponding actions for the specified slots. It also returns additional step outputs containing values, policy details, and actions.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
- Ensure that the network_handler provided during initialization is properly configured and trained.
- The temperature parameter affects the randomness of action selection; a lower value results in more deterministic actions.
- Setting calculate_all_policies to True will increase computational overhead as policies for all players are calculated regardless of the slots_list argument.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
([1, 3], {'values': [0.85, 0.76], 'policy': [[0.2, 0.4, 0.4], [0.1, 0.3, 0.6]], 'actions': [[1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2]]})
- The first element is a list of actions for the specified slots.
- The second element is a dictionary containing values, policy distributions, and actions for each player.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, network_handler, num_players, temperature, calculate_all_policies)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the Policy class with specified parameters.

parameters:
· network_handler: An instance of network.network.NetworkHandler that handles the neural network operations.
· num_players: An integer representing the number of players in the game, such as 7 for a typical setup.
· temperature: A float value used as the policy sampling temperature; this parameter influences the randomness of the policy selection process. For evaluation purposes, a temperature of 0.1 was utilized according to the paper.
· calculate_all_policies: A boolean flag indicating whether to compute policies for all players regardless of the slots_list argument provided to the actions method. This does not impact the sampled policy but enriches the step_outputs with additional data.

Code Description:
The __init__ function initializes a Policy object by setting up its internal state based on the provided parameters. It assigns the network_handler, num_players, and temperature to their respective instance variables. The _obs_transform_state is initialized as None, which suggests it might be used later in the class for transforming observations into states. The string representation of the policy, stored in _str, includes the temperature value formatted within a template string 'OnPolicy(t={self._temperature})'. Lastly, the calculate_all_policies flag is assigned to an instance variable, indicating whether all player policies should be calculated during action generation.

Note: It is crucial to ensure that the network_handler provided is correctly configured and compatible with the Policy class. The num_players parameter must accurately reflect the number of players in the game environment being simulated or analyzed. The temperature value plays a significant role in determining the exploration-exploitation trade-off; hence, it should be set according to the desired behavior of the policy during training or evaluation. The calculate_all_policies flag can be used to gather more comprehensive data about player policies but does not affect the primary sampled policy output.

### FunctionDef __str__(self)
**__str__**: The function of __str__ is to return a string representation of the Policy object.
parameters: This Function does not take any parameters.
Code Description: The __str__ method is a special method in Python used to define a human-readable string representation of an object. In this implementation, it simply returns the value stored in the instance variable _str. This means that whenever an instance of the Policy class is converted to a string (e.g., via print() or str()), the content of _str will be returned.
Note: The method relies on the existence and correct initialization of the _str attribute within the Policy class instances. If _str is not properly set, this method may return unexpected results or raise an AttributeError if _str does not exist.
Output Example: Assuming that the _str attribute of a Policy instance has been set to "Allow all traffic from 192.168.1.0/24", calling str(policy_instance) would output "Allow all traffic from 192.168.1.0/24".
***
### FunctionDef reset(self)
**reset**: The function of reset is to reinitialize certain internal states within the Policy class.
parameters: This Function does not accept any parameters.
Code Description: The reset method sets the _obs_transform_state attribute to None, effectively clearing its current value. It then calls the reset method on the _network_handler object, presumably to perform a similar reinitialization or cleanup operation within that component. This function is likely used to prepare the Policy instance for a new sequence of operations or to return it to a known initial state.
Note: Points to note about the use of the code include ensuring that the _network_handler object has a reset method defined, as this method is called directly on it. Additionally, developers should be aware that calling reset will clear any stored state in _obs_transform_state and may have additional side effects within the _network_handler, depending on its implementation.
***
### FunctionDef actions(self, slots_list, observation, legal_actions)
**actions**: The function of actions is to produce a list of lists of actions based on given slots, observations, and legal actions.

**parameters**: 
· slots_list: A sequence of integers representing the slots for which this policy should generate actions.
· observation: An instance of utils.Observation containing data from the environment.
· legal_actions: A sequence of numpy arrays indicating the legal actions available to each player in the game.

**Code Description**: The function begins by determining whether it needs to calculate policies for all players or just those specified in slots_list. It then transforms the observation using a network handler, taking into account the legal actions, the slots to calculate, the previous state of the observation transformation, and a temperature parameter. Following this, the function performs inference on the transformed observations to generate initial outputs, step outputs, and final actions. The final actions are filtered according to the slots_list provided as input, and these actions along with some additional information from the step outputs (values, policy, and actions) are returned.

**Note**: Ensure that the observation and legal_actions parameters are correctly formatted as expected by the network handler's methods. The temperature parameter influences the randomness of the action selection process during inference.

**Output Example**: 
([array([1, 2]), array([3])], {'values': [0.5, 0.7], 'policy': [[0.1, 0.9], [0.4, 0.6]], 'actions': [array([1, 2]), array([3])]})
