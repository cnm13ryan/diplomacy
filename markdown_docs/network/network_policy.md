## ClassDef Policy
**Policy**: The function of Policy is to delegate stepping and updating to a network, serving as an agent in a game environment.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· network_handler: an instance of network.network.NetworkHandler, responsible for handling network-related operations
· num_players: the number of players in the game, which determines the scope of actions to be taken
· temperature: the policy sampling temperature, influencing the randomness of action selection
· calculate_all_policies: a flag indicating whether to calculate policies for all players or only those specified in the slots_list argument
· _obs_transform_state: an internal state variable used for observation transformation
· _str: a string representation of the Policy instance, including the temperature value

**Code Description**: The description of this Class. 
The Policy class is designed to interact with a game environment through a network handler. Upon initialization, it sets up the necessary attributes, including the network handler, number of players, temperature, and calculation flag. The reset method allows for resetting the internal state and the network handler. The actions method is the core functionality, taking in a list of slots, an observation from the environment, and legal actions for each player. It then uses the network handler to transform the observation, perform inference, and produce a list of actions for the specified slots. If calculate_all_policies is True, it calculates policies for all players; otherwise, it only considers the slots provided.

**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code. 
When using the Policy class, it is essential to provide a valid network handler and specify the correct number of players in the game. The temperature value should be chosen based on the desired level of randomness in action selection. Additionally, the calculate_all_policies flag should be set according to whether policies for all players or only specific slots are required.

**Output Example**: 
The actions method returns a tuple containing a list of lists of actions and a dictionary with step outputs, including values, policy, and actions. For instance, if there are two slots (0 and 1) and the game has three possible actions (A, B, C), the output might look like this: ([[[A], [B]], [[C], [A]]], {'values': [...], 'policy': [...], 'actions': [...]})
### FunctionDef __init__(self, network_handler, num_players, temperature, calculate_all_policies)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the Policy object with necessary parameters.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· network_handler: an instance of network.network.NetworkHandler, which handles network-related operations
· num_players: the number of players in a game, represented as an integer value
· temperature: the policy sampling temperature, typically a float value, where 0.1 was used for evaluation purposes
· calculate_all_policies: a boolean flag indicating whether to calculate policies for all players, regardless of other factors

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is responsible for setting up the Policy object by assigning the provided parameters to instance variables. It takes in four key parameters: network_handler, num_players, temperature, and calculate_all_policies. These parameters are then assigned to corresponding instance variables, including _network_handler, _num_players, _temperature, and _calculate_all_policies. Additionally, it initializes other instance variables such as _obs_transform_state to None and creates a string representation of the Policy object based on the temperature value.

**Note**: When using this function, it is essential to provide a valid network_handler instance and appropriate values for num_players and temperature. The calculate_all_policies flag should be set according to the specific requirements of the application, as it affects the calculation of policies for all players. The correct usage of this function will ensure proper initialization of the Policy object, which is crucial for its subsequent functionality.

### FunctionDef __str__(self)
**__str__**: The function of __str__ is to return a string representation of the object.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function are none, as it is a special method that takes no explicit parameters other than the implicit self reference to the instance of the class.
· self: a reference to the current instance of the class
**Code Description**: This function is a special method in Python classes that returns a string representation of the object. When called, it simply returns the value of the _str attribute of the instance, which presumably contains a string that represents the object in a human-readable format. The implementation of this method is straightforward and does not involve any complex logic or operations.
**Note**: It's worth noting that the _str attribute is not defined within this function, so it must be set elsewhere in the class definition. This suggests that the string representation of the object is determined at some other point in the code, and this function simply provides a way to access that representation as a string.
**Output Example**: The output of this function would be a string, such as "Policy: example_policy", although the exact format and content would depend on how the _str attribute is defined and set elsewhere in the class.
***
### FunctionDef reset(self)
**reset**: The function of reset is to restore the policy to its initial state by resetting its observation transformation state and network handler.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· self: A reference to the current instance of the class
**Code Description**: This function resets the policy by setting the _obs_transform_state attribute to None, effectively removing any existing observation transformation state. Additionally, it calls the reset method on the _network_handler object, which is responsible for managing the network's state. By resetting both the observation transformation state and the network handler, this function ensures that the policy is returned to its initial state, ready for new inputs or processing.
**Note**: When using this function, it is essential to be aware that all existing observation transformation states will be lost, and the network handler will also be reset. This function should be used when the policy needs to be reinitialized or restarted, such as at the beginning of a new episode or when changing tasks.
***
### FunctionDef actions(self, slots_list, observation, legal_actions)
**actions**: The function of actions is to produce a list of lists of actions based on given slots, observations, and legal actions.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· slots_list: a sequence of integers representing the slots for which the policy should produce actions
· observation: an object of type utils.Observation containing observations from the environment
· legal_actions: a sequence of numpy arrays representing the legal actions for every player in the game

**Code Description**: This function first determines which slots to calculate actions for, either using the provided slots_list or all players if self._calculate_all_policies is True. It then transforms the observation using the _network_handler's observation_transform method, passing in the observation, legal actions, slots to calculate, previous state, and temperature. The transformed observation is then used for inference by the _network_handler, producing initial outputs and step outputs, as well as final actions. Finally, the function returns a list of final actions for each slot in the original slots_list, along with a dictionary containing additional information about the step, including values, policy, and actions.

**Note**: The function relies on several instance variables, including self._num_players, self._calculate_all_policies, self._network_handler, self._obs_transform_state, and self._temperature. It also assumes that the _network_handler has methods for observation transformation and inference. The output of this function is a tuple containing a list of lists of actions and a dictionary with additional step information.

**Output Example**: The return value of this function could be a tuple where the first element is a list of lists of integers, such as [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], representing the final actions for each slot, and the second element is a dictionary like {'values': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3], 'policy': [0.4, 0.5, 0.6], 'actions': [0.7, 0.8, 0.9]}, containing additional information about the step.
