## ClassDef Policy
**Policy**: The function of Policy is to delegate stepping and updating to a network.
**attributes**:
· network_handler: This parameter represents an instance of `network.network.NetworkHandler`, which handles the interaction with the neural network model used by the policy.
· num_players: An integer representing the number of players in the game, such as 7 for a typical game scenario.
· temperature: A floating-point value that serves as the sampling temperature. This parameter influences how stochastic the action selection process is during inference, with lower values leading to more deterministic actions and higher values making the policy more exploratory.
· calculate_all_policies: A boolean flag indicating whether to compute policies for all players regardless of specific slots provided in the `actions` method call.

**Code Description**: The class `Policy` encapsulates a strategy or agent that operates based on a neural network model. It initializes with necessary parameters and maintains state throughout its operations, particularly through the `_obs_transform_state`. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization (`__init__` Method)**: 
   - The constructor takes in several arguments to initialize the policy object.
   - `network_handler`: This parameter is an instance of `NetworkHandler`, which handles interactions with the neural network model.
   - `num_players`: An integer specifying the number of players involved in the game, such as 7 for a typical game scenario.
   - `temperature`: A floating-point value that influences the stochasticity of action selection during inference. The default temperature used in evaluations was 0.1.
   - `calculate_all_policies`: A boolean flag to determine whether policies should be calculated for all players regardless of the specific slots provided in `actions` method calls.

2. **String Representation (`__str__` Method)**:
   - This method returns a string representation of the policy object, formatted as 'OnPolicy(t={self._temperature})'. It provides a quick visual identifier for the policy instance based on its temperature value.

3. **Resetting State (`reset` Method)**:
   - The `reset` method resets the internal state of the policy by setting `_obs_transform_state` to `None`. Additionally, it calls the `reset` method on the network handler to ensure any necessary state within the network is also reset.

4. **Action Generation (`actions` Method)**:
   - This method generates a list of actions based on the provided slots and observations.
   - The method first determines which players' policies should be calculated, either all or only those specified by `slots_list`.
   - It then transforms the observation using the network handler to prepare it for inference. The transformed observation is used in conjunction with legal actions to produce initial outputs from the network.
   - Finally, these outputs are used to generate final actions and extract relevant step outputs which include values, policies, and actions.

**Note**: Ensure that `network_handler`, `num_players`, `temperature`, and `calculate_all_policies` are correctly initialized before using this class. The method `actions` requires specific inputs such as `slots_list`, `observation`, and `legal_actions`. Make sure these inputs match the expected types and formats.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Assuming a Policy instance has been created with appropriate parameters.
policy = Policy(network_handler, num_players=7, temperature=0.1, calculate_all_policies=False)

# Generate actions for specific slots [0, 2, 5]
actions, step_outputs = policy.actions(slots_list=[0, 2, 5], observation=some_observation, legal_actions=some_legal_actions)
```
The `actions` method would return a tuple where the first element is a list of action sequences for each slot in `slots_list`, and the second element contains detailed step outputs such as values, policies, and actions.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, network_handler, num_players, temperature, calculate_all_policies)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the Policy class.
**parameters**:
· network_handler: `network.network.NetworkHandler`
   - This parameter represents the handler responsible for managing the neural network model that will be used to generate policies based on game states. It ensures that the policy can access and utilize the correct model when making decisions.
· num_players: Number of players in game (i.e., 7)
   - This integer value specifies the number of participants in the game, which is crucial for determining the context and scope of the policy's actions. The number of players influences how state transformations and action calculations are handled internally.
· temperature: Policy sampling temperature (0.1 was used for evaluation in paper)
   - This parameter controls the randomness or stochasticity of the policy selection process. A lower value results in more deterministic choices, while a higher value introduces more variability. The default value provided by the research paper is 0.1, but this can be adjusted based on specific requirements.
· calculate_all_policies: Whether to calculate policy for all players regardless of the slots_list argument to actions method. Does not affect the sampled policy, but adds more data to the step_outputs
   - This boolean flag determines whether the policy should compute strategies for every player in a given turn, irrespective of which specific set of players are relevant at that moment. While this does not influence the final sampled policy, it can generate additional output data useful for analysis or debugging purposes.

**Code Description**: The code initializes an instance of the Policy class with the provided parameters.
- `self._network_handler = network_handler`: This line stores the network handler in a private attribute `_network_handler`, which will be used throughout the instance's lifetime to interact with the neural network model.
- `self._num_players = num_players`: The number of players is stored as an instance variable `_num_players` for easy access and reference within methods of this class.
- `self._obs_transform_state = None`: This attribute is initialized to `None`, indicating that no specific state transformation function has been set up yet. It can be assigned later based on specific game requirements or during method calls.
- `self._temperature = temperature`: The policy sampling temperature is stored as `_temperature` and used in various parts of the policy logic, particularly when generating actions from the model outputs.
- `self._str = f'OnPolicy(t={self._temperature})'`: A string representation of the policy instance is created using an f-string. This helps in logging or debugging by providing a clear label that includes the current temperature setting.
- `self._calculate_all_policies = calculate_all_policies`: The boolean value for whether to compute policies for all players, regardless of the current context, is stored as `_calculate_all_policies`. This attribute influences how certain methods handle player-specific actions and state transformations.

**Note**: Ensure that the `network_handler` provided is correctly configured and contains a valid neural network model. The `num_players` value should accurately reflect the game being played to avoid logical errors in policy generation. Adjusting the `temperature` parameter can significantly impact the behavior of the policy, so it's important to test different values during development and fine-tuning phases. When setting `_calculate_all_policies`, consider its implications on performance and output data size; enabling this feature may generate substantial additional data that could be resource-intensive.

### FunctionDef __str__(self)
**__str__**: The function of __str__ is to return a string representation of the Policy object.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `__str__` method is defined within the `Policy` class and serves as a special method in Python. It is automatically called when an instance of the `Policy` class needs to be converted to a string, such as when printing the object or using the `print()` function. The implementation simply returns the value stored in the `_str` attribute of the Policy object.
```python
def __str__(self):
    return self._str
```
This method ensures that any user-defined behavior for converting an instance to a string is encapsulated within the class, providing a clean and consistent way to represent objects.

**Note**: Ensure that the `_str` attribute has been properly set before calling this method. If it hasn't been initialized or if it contains invalid data types, unexpected results may occur.
**Output Example**: 
If an instance of `Policy` is created with a string representation stored in its `_str` attribute, such as:
```python
policy = Policy(_str="Security Policy for Network Access")
print(policy)
```
The output would be:
```
Security Policy for Network Access
```
***
### FunctionDef reset(self)
**reset**: The function of reset is to clear internal state and restart network operations.
**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.
· parameter1: None (The method does not accept any external arguments)
**Code Description**: 
The `reset` method serves to clear the internal state and restart network operations. Specifically, it performs two main tasks:
- It sets `_obs_transform_state` to `None`. This variable likely holds some transformed or processed observation data used in the policy. By setting it to `None`, any existing transformation is removed, effectively clearing this state.
- It calls the `reset` method on `_network_handler`. The `_network_handler` is an instance of a class responsible for handling network-related operations. Resetting this handler likely prepares the network for new operations or clears its internal state.

This function ensures that the policy and associated network handlers are in a known initial state, which can be crucial for maintaining consistency across multiple runs or scenarios where the current state might interfere with expected behavior.
**Note**: Ensure that any external resources managed by `_network_handler` are properly released before resetting to avoid resource leaks. Also, consider the implications of clearing the observation transformation state on subsequent policy evaluations and ensure this does not affect the integrity of your application's logic.
***
### FunctionDef actions(self, slots_list, observation, legal_actions)
**actions**: The function of actions is to produce a list of lists of actions based on given slots, observation, and legal actions.
**parameters**: 
· slots_list: A sequence of integers indicating the slots this policy should produce actions for.
· observation: An utils.Observation object containing observations from the environment.
· legal_actions: A sequence of numpy arrays representing the legal actions available to each player in the game.

**Code Description**: The function `actions` is responsible for generating a list of actions based on the provided parameters. Here’s a detailed analysis:

1. **Initialization and Calculation of Slots**: 
   - If `_calculate_all_policies` is set, it calculates all policy slots; otherwise, it uses the provided `slots_list`.
   
2. **Observation Transformation**:
   - The function transforms the observation using the `_network_handler.observation_transform()` method. This method takes in the current observation, legal actions, and a list of slots to calculate. It also considers the previous state (`self._obs_transform_state`) and temperature for transformation.
   - The transformed observation is stored in `transformed_obs`, and the state after transformation is stored in `_obs_transform_state`.

3. **Network Inference**:
   - The transformed observation is then used for inference via the `_network_handler.inference()` method, which returns a tuple containing initial outputs (`initial_outs`) and step-wise outputs (`step_outs`), along with final actions.

4. **Action Selection and Output Compilation**:
   - From the `final_actions`, only those corresponding to the provided `slots_list` are selected.
   - A dictionary of additional information is compiled, including values from `initial_outs` and policies and actions from `step_outs`.

5. **Return Values**:
   - The function returns a tuple containing two elements: 
     - A list of action sequences corresponding to the slots in `slots_list`.
     - A dictionary containing step outputs with keys 'values', 'policy', and 'actions'.

**Note**: Ensure that `_network_handler`, `_num_players`, and other related attributes are properly initialized before calling this function. Also, verify that `utils.Observation` is correctly defined and compatible with the input observation.

**Output Example**: The return value could look something like:
```python
([action_sequence_for_slot1, action_sequence_for_slot2], 
 {'values': [value1, value2],
  'policy': [policy1, policy2],
  'actions': [action1, action2]})
```
Where `action_sequence_for_slotX` is a sequence of actions for the corresponding slot, and the dictionary contains relevant step outputs for further analysis or logging.
