**NetworkTest**: The function of NetworkTest is to provide a comprehensive testing framework for network-related components.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class are not explicitly defined, but it inherits from parameterized.TestCase, which suggests that it utilizes parameterized testing capabilities.

· parameterized: This attribute enables the class to leverage parameterized testing, allowing for multiple test cases to be executed with varying input parameters.

**Code Description**: The NetworkTest class is designed to test various aspects of network components, including encoder core, board encoder, relational order decoder, shared representation, inference, and loss information. It comprises several test methods, each focusing on a specific component or functionality. These methods employ parameterized testing to cover different scenarios and input conditions. The class utilizes the hk.testing.transform_and_run decorator to execute tests within a transformed and run context.

The test methods are structured to verify the correctness of network components by checking output shapes, values, and other relevant properties. For instance, the test_encoder_core method tests the EncoderCore component by validating its output shape against expected dimensions. Similarly, the test_board_encoder method verifies the BoardEncoder component's output shape and value. The test_relational_order_decoder method checks the RelationalOrderDecoder component's output shape and value, while the test_shared_rep method validates the shared representation's output shape and value.

The class also includes methods for testing inference and loss information. The test_inference method verifies the inference process by checking the output shapes and values of initial outputs and step outputs. The test_loss_info method tests the loss information by validating the presence of expected keys in the loss info dictionary and checking their corresponding values.

**Note**: When utilizing this class, it is essential to ensure that the input parameters and testing conditions are correctly configured to cover all relevant scenarios and edge cases. Additionally, the class's inheritance from parameterized.TestCase requires careful consideration of parameterized testing principles to maximize test coverage and effectiveness.

**Output Example**: The output of the NetworkTest class will typically consist of test results indicating pass or fail status for each test method. For example, a successful test run might produce output similar to:
Test case test_encoder_core (training=True) passed
Test case test_encoder_core (training=False) passed
Test case test_board_encoder (training=True) passed
...
where each test case is reported with its corresponding input parameters and outcome.

**Code Description**: This function initializes a set of input parameters, including batch size, number of nodes, input size, filter size, and expected output size. It generates a random adjacency matrix using the _random_adjacency_matrix function and creates a tensor of random input values with the specified shape. The EncoderCore model is then instantiated with the generated adjacency matrix and filter size. If the is_training flag is False, the model is first called with is_training set to True to ensure that moving averages are created. The model is then called with the input tensors and the is_training flag, and its output shape is compared against the expected output shape using an assertion statement. The _random_adjacency_matrix function plays a crucial role in this test by providing a normalized adjacency matrix, which is used directly in the EncoderCore model.
**Note**: The test_encoder_core function relies on the correct implementation of the EncoderCore model and the _random_adjacency_matrix function to generate valid input data.
