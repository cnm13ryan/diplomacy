## FunctionDef _random_adjacency_matrix(num_nodes)
**Function Overview**

The `_random_adjacency_matrix` function generates a random symmetric adjacency matrix suitable for representing undirected graphs.

**Parameters**

- `num_nodes: int`: The number of nodes (vertices) in the graph. This parameter determines the size of the square adjacency matrix to be generated.

**Return Values**

- Returns a 2D NumPy array (`np.ndarray`) of shape `(num_nodes, num_nodes)` representing the adjacency matrix. Each element in the matrix is either `0` or `1`, indicating the absence or presence of an edge between two nodes.

**Detailed Explanation**

The `_random_adjacency_matrix` function constructs a random symmetric binary adjacency matrix for an undirected graph with `num_nodes`. Here’s how it works:

1. **Random Matrix Generation**: The function starts by generating a random binary matrix using `np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(num_nodes, num_nodes))`. This creates a matrix where each element is either `0` or `1`, representing the absence or presence of an edge between two nodes.

2. **Symmetrization**: To ensure the adjacency matrix represents an undirected graph (where edges have no direction), the function adds the matrix to its transpose (`adjacency = adjacency + adjacency.T`). This operation ensures that if there is an edge from node `i` to node `j`, there is also an edge from node `j` to node `i`.

3. **Binary Clipping**: After symmetrization, some elements in the matrix might exceed `1`. The function uses `np.clip(adjacency, 0, 1)` to clip all values back to either `0` or `1`, maintaining the binary nature of the adjacency matrix.

4. **Self-Loops Removal**: Undirected graphs typically do not have self-loops (edges from a node to itself). The function removes these by setting the diagonal elements to `0` using `adjacency[np.diag_indices(adjacency.shape[0])] = 0`.

5. **Normalization and Type Conversion**: Finally, the function normalizes the adjacency matrix using `network.normalize_adjacency(adjacency.astype(np.float32))`. This step might involve scaling or other transformations specific to the network's requirements.

**Usage Notes**

- **Symmetric Graphs**: The generated adjacency matrix is guaranteed to be symmetric, which is essential for undirected graphs.
  
- **Binary Edges**: The function uses binary values (`0` and `1`) to represent edges. This simplicity can be advantageous for certain graph algorithms but might not capture weighted edges.

- **Performance Considerations**: For large `num_nodes`, the memory usage of the adjacency matrix is quadratic (`O(num_nodes^2)`). Ensure that your environment has sufficient resources when generating large matrices.

- **Edge Cases**: 
  - If `num_nodes` is `0`, the function returns an empty matrix.
  - The function does not handle cases where `num_nodes` is negative, as this would result in invalid matrix dimensions.

### FunctionDef test_encoder_core(self, is_training)
**Function Overview**

The `test_encoder_core` function is designed to test the functionality and output shape of the `EncoderCore` model within a network. It verifies that the model processes input tensors correctly based on specified parameters.

**Parameters**

- `is_training: bool`: A boolean flag indicating whether the model is in training mode (`True`) or inference mode (`False`). This parameter influences how certain layers, such as batch normalization, operate during the forward pass.

**Return Values**

- The function does not return any values. Instead, it asserts that the shape of the output tensors matches the expected dimensions.

**Detailed Explanation**

The `test_encoder_core` function is a unit test designed to validate the behavior of the `EncoderCore` model. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of its logic and flow:

1. **Parameter Initialization**: The function initializes several parameters:
   - `batch_size`: Set to 10, representing the number of samples in each batch.
   - `num_nodes`: Set to 5, indicating the number of nodes in the graph represented by the adjacency matrix.
   - `input_size`: Set to 4, specifying the size of input features for each node.
   - `filter_size`: Set to 8, determining the size of filters used in the convolutional operations within the model.
   - `expected_output_size`: Calculated as `2 * filter_size`, representing the concatenated output from both edge and node encodings.

2. **Adjacency Matrix Generation**: The function generates a random symmetric adjacency matrix using the `_random_adjacency_matrix` function, passing `num_nodes` as an argument. This matrix represents the connectivity of nodes in the graph.

3. **Input Tensor Creation**: Random input tensors are generated using NumPy's `np.random.randn`, with dimensions `(batch_size, num_nodes, input_size)`. These tensors simulate node features for each sample in the batch.

4. **Model Initialization**: An instance of the `EncoderCore` model is created, initialized with the generated adjacency matrix and filter size.

5. **Training Mode Setup**: If the `is_training` parameter is `False`, the function first runs the model in training mode (`is_training=True`). This step ensures that moving averages for batch normalization layers are created before switching to inference mode.

6. **Model Execution**: The model is executed with the input tensors and the specified `is_training` mode. The output from this execution is stored in `output_tensors`.

7. **Shape Assertion**: Finally, the function asserts that the shape of `output_tensors` matches the expected dimensions `(batch_size, num_nodes, expected_output_size)`. This assertion checks whether the model produces outputs with the correct size and structure.

**Usage Notes**

- **Training vs. Inference Mode**: The function demonstrates how to switch between training and inference modes in the model. It is crucial to initialize moving averages in training mode before performing inference to ensure consistent behavior.
  
- **Batch Size and Node Count**: The test uses fixed batch sizes and node counts, which may need adjustment for different use cases or models with varying input dimensions.

- **Performance Considerations**: Generating large adjacency matrices and processing tensors with high dimensions can be computationally expensive. Ensure that the testing environment has sufficient resources to handle these operations efficiently.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `batch_size` is set to `0`, the function will not generate any input tensors, potentially leading to an assertion failure.
  - The function assumes that the `EncoderCore` model is correctly implemented and does not handle cases where the model fails during execution.

### FunctionDef test_board_encoder(self, is_training)
**Function Overview**

The `test_board_encoder` function is a unit test designed to validate the functionality of the `BoardEncoder` model within the network module. It ensures that the model correctly processes input data and produces output tensors with the expected shape.

**Parameters**

- `is_training: bool`: A boolean flag indicating whether the model should be run in training mode (`True`) or inference mode (`False`). This parameter affects how certain layers, such as batch normalization, behave during execution.

**Return Values**

- The function does not return any values explicitly. Instead, it asserts that the shape of the output tensors matches the expected dimensions, raising an assertion error if this condition is not met.

**Detailed Explanation**

The `test_board_encoder` function performs the following steps to test the `BoardEncoder` model:

1. **Initialization of Parameters and Constants**:
   - `batch_size`: Set to 10, representing the number of samples in a batch.
   - `input_size`: Set to 4, indicating the size of input features for each node.
   - `filter_size`: Set to 8, specifying the size of filters used by the model.
   - `num_players`: Set to 7, representing the number of players or entities involved in the game state.
   - `expected_output_size`: Calculated as `2 * filter_size` (concatenating edge and node features).

2. **Generation of Input Data**:
   - `adjacency`: A random symmetric adjacency matrix generated using `_random_adjacency_matrix`, representing the connectivity between nodes.
   - `state_representation`: A 3D NumPy array with shape `(batch_size, utils.NUM_AREAS, input_size)`, filled with random values to simulate game states.
   - `season`: A 1D NumPy array of size `(batch_size,)` containing random integers representing different seasons or stages in the game.
   - `build_numbers`: A 2D NumPy array with shape `(batch_size, num_players)` containing random integers representing build numbers for each player.

3. **Model Initialization and Execution**:
   - The `BoardEncoder` model is instantiated with the generated adjacency matrix and other parameters (`player_filter_size`, `num_players`, `num_seasons`).
   - If `is_training` is `False`, the model is first run in training mode to initialize moving averages, which are crucial for batch normalization layers.
   - The model is then executed again with the same input data but using the actual `is_training` flag.

4. **Assertion of Output Shape**:
   - The function asserts that the shape of the output tensors matches `(batch_size, num_players, utils.NUM_AREAS, expected_output_size)`. If this assertion fails, an error is raised indicating a mismatch between the expected and actual output dimensions.

**Usage Notes**

- **Training vs. Inference Mode**: The `is_training` parameter allows testing both training and inference modes of the model. It's important to ensure that the model behaves correctly in both scenarios.
  
- **Random Input Data**: The use of random input data helps in verifying the model's ability to handle varied inputs. However, this approach does not test specific edge cases or corner conditions.

- **Performance Considerations**: For large batch sizes or complex models, the execution time and memory usage can be significant. Ensure that the testing environment is appropriately configured to handle these demands.

- **Edge Cases**: The function assumes that all input parameters are valid and within expected ranges. Testing with invalid inputs (e.g., negative numbers for `batch_size`) should be performed separately to ensure robustness.

- **Model Initialization**: Running the model in training mode before inference ensures that moving averages are initialized correctly, which is essential for accurate batch normalization behavior during inference.

**Parameters**

- `is_training: bool`: A boolean flag indicating whether the model is in training mode (`True`) or inference mode (`False`). This parameter influences how the decoder behaves during its execution.

**Return Values**

- The function does not return any values explicitly. Instead, it asserts that the output shape of the decoder matches the expected dimensions.

**Detailed Explanation**

The `test_relational_order_decoder` function is structured to validate the behavior of the `RelationalOrderDecoder` class under different conditions. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of its logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - **Batch Size and Number of Players**: The function sets `batch_size` to 10 and `num_players` to 7, defining the number of sequences to process.
   - **Adjacency Matrix**: It generates a random adjacency matrix using `_random_adjacency_matrix`, specifying the number of nodes as `utils.NUM_PROVINCES`.
   - **Relational Order Decoder**: An instance of `RelationalOrderDecoder` is created with the generated adjacency matrix.

     - `legal_actions_mask`: A mask indicating legal actions at each step.
     - `teacher_forcing`: A boolean array controlling teacher forcing during training.
     - `previous_teacher_forcing_action`: An integer array tracking previous actions for teacher forcing.
     - `temperature`: A float array used to control the randomness of action selection.

3. **Initial State**:
   - The decoder’s initial state is obtained using the `initial_state` method, specifying the batch size as `batch_size * num_players`.

4. **Training Mode Setup**:
   - If the model is not in training mode (`is_training=False`), the function ensures that moving averages are created by running a single step of the decoder with the first time step of the input sequence.

5. **Sequence Processing**:
   - The function iterates over each time step (from 0 to `action_utils.MAX_ORDERS`) and processes the input sequence using the decoder.
   - At each step, it extracts the relevant slice of the input sequence for the current time step and passes it along with the current state to the decoder.
   - The outputs from the decoder are stored, and the state is updated for the next iteration.

6. **Assertion**:
   - After processing all time steps, the function asserts that the shape of the decoder’s output matches the expected dimensions (`(batch_size * num_players, action_utils.MAX_ORDERS)`).

**Usage Notes**

- The function assumes that `utils.NUM_PROVINCES` is defined and represents a valid number of nodes for the adjacency matrix.
- The performance of this test can be impacted by the size of `batch_size`, `num_players`, and `action_utils.MAX_ORDERS`. Larger values may require more computational resources.
- Edge cases, such as very small or very large input sizes, should be tested separately to ensure robustness.
- The function does not handle exceptions or errors that might occur during execution. It is assumed that the decoder and its components are correctly implemented elsewhere in the system.

### FunctionDef test_loss_info(self)
---

**Function Overview**

The `test_loss_info` function is designed to validate the structure and content of the loss information returned by a neural network model during training. It ensures that the expected keys are present in the loss dictionary and that each value has an empty shape.

**Parameters**

- **None**: The function does not take any parameters directly; however, it relies on internal variables and configurations defined within the method itself.

**Return Values**

- **None**: The function does not return any values. It performs assertions to validate the structure of the loss information.

**Detailed Explanation**

The `test_loss_info` function is a unit test method intended for use with Python's unittest framework. Its primary purpose is to verify that the neural network model, instantiated with specific configurations, produces a valid dictionary containing expected keys and empty values as part of its loss computation.

1. **Initialization of Variables**:
   - `batch_size`, `time_steps`, and `num_players` are set to 4, 2, and 7 respectively.
   - `network_kwargs` is obtained by calling the `test_network_rod_kwargs()` function, which returns a dictionary with configuration parameters for the neural network.

2. **Network Instantiation**:
   - A neural network instance (`net`) is created using the `network.Network` class, initialized with the configurations provided in `network_kwargs`.

3. **Observation Preparation**:
   - Zero observations are generated using the `network.Network.zero_observation()` method, tailored to the number of players.
   - These observations are then expanded into sequences by repeating them along a time axis (`time_steps + 1`).
   - Finally, the sequence observations are batched by repeating them along a batch axis (`batch_size`).

4. **Data Preparation**:
   - Arrays for `rewards`, `discounts`, `actions`, and `returns` are initialized with zeros. These arrays simulate training data inputs to the network.
     - `rewards` and `discounts` have shapes `(batch_size, time_steps + 1, num_players)`.
     - `actions` has a shape of `(batch_size, time_steps, num_players, action_utils.MAX_ORDERS)`.
     - `returns` has a shape of `(batch_size, time_steps, num_players)`.

5. **Loss Computation**:
   - The `loss_info` method of the network instance is called with the prepared data and step outputs (`actions` and `returns`). This method computes various loss metrics relevant to the training process.
   - The returned `loss_info` dictionary is expected to contain specific keys related to different types of losses and accuracies.

6. **Validation**:
   - The function asserts that the set of keys in `loss_info` matches a predefined list of expected keys (`expected_keys`). This ensures that all necessary loss components are present.
   - For each value in the `loss_info` dictionary, it asserts that the shape is an empty tuple (`()`), indicating scalar values.

**Usage Notes**

- **Dependencies**: The function relies on several external modules and classes such as `network.Network`, `tree.map_structure`, and `action_utils.MAX_ORDERS`. Ensure these are correctly imported and available in the execution environment.
  
- **Configuration**: The configuration returned by `test_network_rod_kwargs()` is crucial for setting up the network. Adjustments to this function may require corresponding changes in the test logic.

- **Performance Considerations**: The function prepares large arrays of zeros, which could impact performance on systems with limited memory resources. This is particularly relevant when scaling up `batch_size`, `time_steps`, or `num_players`.

- **Edge Cases**: The function assumes that the network's `loss_info` method will always return a dictionary with scalar values for each key. If the method changes to return non-scalar values, additional assertions may be required.

### FunctionDef test_inference_not_is_training(self)
### Function Overview

**`test_inference_not_is_training`**: Tests the inference process of a network with `is_training` set to `False`.

### Parameters

- **None**: The function does not take any parameters directly. It uses predefined constants and functions within its scope.

### Return Values

- **None**: The function does not return any values. Its purpose is to perform assertions or checks during testing.

### Detailed Explanation

The `test_inference_not_is_training` function is designed to test the inference process of a network when it is set to operate in non-training mode (`is_training=False`). This is crucial for ensuring that the network behaves correctly under different operational states, particularly when deployed in production environments where training parameters are not applicable.

#### Step-by-Step Logic

1. **Initialization**:
   - Constants such as `batch_size`, `time_steps`, and `num_players` are defined to simulate a batch of observations.
   - Network configuration (`network_kwargs`) is generated using the `test_network_rod_kwargs` function, which sets up parameters like adjacency matrices, filter sizes, and core numbers.

2. **Observation Preparation**:
   - Zero observations are created using `network.Network.zero_observation`, tailored to the number of players.
   - These observations are then expanded into sequences by repeating them across time steps (`time_steps + 1`).
   - The sequence observations are further batched by repeating them across a specified batch size.

3. **Reward, Discount, Action, and Return Preparation**:
   - Arrays for rewards, discounts, actions, and returns are initialized with zeros to simulate a scenario where no specific values are provided.
   - A random number generator (`rng`) is set up using JAX's `PRNGKey` to ensure reproducibility.

4. **Loss Module Initialization**:
   - A loss module is defined using Haiku (`hk.transform_with_state`) to encapsulate the network's loss computation logic.
   - Parameters and state are initialized for this loss module using a training configuration (`is_training=True`).

5. **Inference Module Definition**:
   - An inference function is defined, which sets up the network with `is_training=False`.
   - This function is also transformed into an Haiku module to handle stateful operations.

6. **Inference Execution**:
   - The inference module is applied using the parameters and state initialized from the loss module.
   - This step simulates a test-time scenario where the network performs inference without training updates.

### Usage Notes

- **Limitations**: The function assumes that all necessary modules (`network`, `hk`, `jax`, etc.) are correctly imported and available in the environment. It also relies on predefined functions like `test_network_rod_kwargs`.
  
- **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle scenarios where network initialization fails or when input data is malformed. These cases should be addressed in a more comprehensive test suite.

- **Performance Considerations**: The function involves multiple transformations and state handling, which can impact performance, especially with large batch sizes or complex network architectures. It is recommended to optimize these operations for better scalability in production environments.
#### FunctionDef _loss_info(unused_step_types, rewards, discounts, observations, step_outputs)
---

**Function Overview**

#### FunctionDef inference(observations, num_copies_each_observation)
## Function Overview

The `inference` function is designed to perform inference operations on a given set of observations using a pre-configured neural network model. The function initializes the network with specific parameters and then leverages it to process the input data.

## Parameters

- **observations**: A list or array containing the input data for which inference needs to be performed.
- **num_copies_each_observation**: An integer specifying how many copies of each observation should be processed by the network. This parameter is used to control the batch size and parallelism during inference.

## Return Values

The function returns the result of the inference operation, which typically includes predictions or outputs generated by the neural network model based on the input observations.

## Detailed Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - The `inference` function begins by creating an instance of a neural network (`net`) using the `network.Network` class.
   - The network is initialized with parameters obtained from the `test_network_rod_kwargs` function, where the `is_training` parameter is explicitly set to `False`. This configuration ensures that the network operates in inference mode rather than training mode.

2. **Configuration**:
   - The `test_network_rod_kwargs` function generates a dictionary (`network_kwargs`) containing various parameters essential for configuring the neural network.
   - Key parameters include:
     - `adjacency`: A normalized adjacency matrix representing relationships between different entities (e.g., provinces).
     - `filter_size`: The size of the filters used in convolutional layers, set to 8 by default.
     - `num_cores`: The number of cores or parallel processing units allocated for certain operations within the network.

3. **Inference Execution**:
   - Once the network is configured, the function calls the `inference` method of the network instance (`net.inference`) with the provided observations and the number of copies for each observation.
   - The `inference` method processes the input data through the network's layers, generating predictions or outputs based on the learned patterns.

## Usage Notes

- **Inference Mode**: By setting `is_training=False`, the function ensures that the network operates in inference mode. This disables training-specific operations such as dropout and batch normalization, which are not required during prediction.
  
- **Batch Size Control**: The `num_copies_each_observation` parameter allows for controlling the batch size. Increasing this number can lead to higher throughput but may require more memory resources.

- **Performance Considerations**:
  - The performance of the inference operation is influenced by the complexity of the network and the size of the input data.
  - For large-scale applications, consider optimizing the network architecture or leveraging hardware acceleration (e.g., GPUs) to enhance processing speed.

- **Edge Cases**: 
  - Ensure that the input observations are preprocessed correctly before calling the `inference` function. The network expects data in a specific format and may produce incorrect results if the input is malformed.
  - Handle potential exceptions or errors gracefully, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex models.

By following these guidelines, developers can effectively utilize the `inference` function to perform accurate predictions using the specified neural network model.

### FunctionDef test_take_gradients(self)
---

**Function Overview**

The `test_take_gradients` function is designed to test the application of a gradient update step within a neural network framework. This function simulates a batched sequence of observations and actions, computes loss using a specified network configuration, and verifies the correctness of gradient computation and optimization.

**Parameters**

- **None**: The function does not accept any explicit parameters. All necessary data is generated internally or passed through nested functions.

**Return Values**

- **None**: The function does not return any values. Its primary purpose is to test internal operations rather than produce output for further use.

**Detailed Explanation**

1. **Initialization of Test Parameters**
   - `batch_size`, `time_steps`, and `num_players` are set to 4, 2, and 7 respectively, defining the dimensions of the test data.
   - `network_kwargs` is generated using the `test_network_rod_kwargs` function, which configures network parameters such as adjacency matrices and filter sizes.

2. **Data Preparation**
   - `observations` are initialized to zero using `network.Network.zero_observation`, tailored to the number of players.
   - These observations are then expanded into sequences over time steps and further batched to simulate a typical training scenario.

3. **Loss Function Definition**
   - `_loss_info` is defined as an inner function that constructs a network instance and computes loss information based on input data (rewards, discounts, observations, step_outputs).
   - `hk.transform_with_state(_loss_info)` transforms this function into a Haiku module capable of managing stateful computations.

4. **Parameter Initialization**
   - The network parameters (`params`) and state (`loss_state`) are initialized using the transformed `_loss_info` module with a random seed (`rng`).

5. **Loss Computation and Gradient Calculation**
   - `_loss` is another inner function that computes the total loss from the network's output and applies gradients.
   - `jax.value_and_grad(_loss, has_aux=True)` computes both the value of the loss function and its gradients with respect to the parameters.

6. **Optimization Step**
   - An Adam optimizer (`optax.adam(0.001)`) is initialized with a learning rate of 0.001.
   - The optimizer updates the network parameters based on the computed gradients, simulating one step of gradient descent.

**Usage Notes**

- **Test Environment**: This function is intended for use in a testing environment to verify the correctness of gradient computation and optimization within the specified neural network architecture.
- **Dependencies**: The function relies on external libraries such as JAX, Haiku (`hk`), Optax, and NumPy. Ensure these are properly installed and imported before running the test.
- **Performance Considerations**: Due to the use of JAX for gradient computation and optimization, this function may require significant computational resources, especially with larger batch sizes or more complex network configurations.

#### FunctionDef _loss_info(unused_step_types, rewards, discounts, observations, step_outputs)
**Function Overview**

The `_loss_info` function is designed to compute and return loss information from a neural network model. It takes several inputs related to training data and outputs the computed loss details.

**Parameters**

- `unused_step_types`: A parameter that is not used within the function. Its purpose or usage is unclear based on the provided code.
- `rewards`: An array of rewards received during each step of the training process.
- `discounts`: An array of discount factors applied to future rewards, typically used in reinforcement learning contexts.
- `observations`: A collection of observations or states encountered during training.
- `step_outputs`: Outputs from previous steps that may be relevant for loss computation.

**Return Values**

The function returns the result of calling `net.loss_info`, which is expected to provide details about the computed loss, such as the loss value itself and possibly gradients or other diagnostic information.

**Detailed Explanation**

1. **Initialization**: The function begins by initializing a neural network instance using the `network.Network` class. The parameters for this initialization are obtained from the `test_network_rod_kwargs` function.
   
2. **Network Configuration**: The `test_network_rod_kwargs` function configures various aspects of the network, including adjacency matrices derived from map data, filter sizes, and core numbers. It also sets up the RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) constructor and its associated keyword arguments.

3. **Loss Computation**: Once the network is initialized with the specified parameters, the `_loss_info` function calls `net.loss_info`. This method computes loss based on the provided training data (`rewards`, `discounts`, `observations`, `step_outputs`). The first argument passed to `loss_info` is `None`, which might indicate that certain default values or configurations are being used.

4. **Return**: The computed loss information is returned by the function, allowing it to be used for further analysis or optimization during training.

**Usage Notes**

- **Unused Parameters**: The `unused_step_types` parameter does not affect the computation within this function and can be ignored.
- **Training Context**: This function is likely part of a larger training loop where loss information is continuously computed and used to update model parameters.
- **Performance Considerations**: The performance of `_loss_info` is dependent on the underlying network architecture and the complexity of the computations involved in `net.loss_info`. Efficient implementation of these components can significantly impact overall training speed and resource usage.

#### FunctionDef _loss(params, state, rng, rewards, discounts, observations, step_outputs)
---

**Function Overview**

The `_loss` function computes the total loss from a given set of parameters and state, applying a loss module to calculate losses based on rewards, discounts, observations, and step outputs. It returns the mean of the total loss along with detailed loss information and the updated state.

**Parameters**

- **params**: A collection of model parameters used in the computation.
- **state**: The current state of the system or network being evaluated.
- **rng**: A random number generator key for reproducibility in stochastic computations.
- **rewards**: An array of rewards received at each step, influencing the loss calculation.
- **discounts**: An array of discount factors applied to future rewards, affecting the temporal aspect of the loss computation.
- **observations**: A sequence of observations or inputs from the environment at each step.
- **step_outputs**: Outputs generated by the network for each step, used in conjunction with other parameters to compute losses.

**Return Values**

- **total_loss**: The mean value of the total loss calculated across all steps.
- **(losses, state)**: A tuple containing a dictionary of detailed losses and the updated state after applying the loss module.

**Detailed Explanation**

The `_loss` function operates by invoking the `apply` method of the `loss_module`, passing in the provided parameters (`params`), current state (`state`), random number generator key (`rng`), rewards, discounts, observations, and step outputs. The `apply` method computes various losses based on these inputs.

The returned value from `apply` includes a dictionary of losses and an updated state. The function specifically extracts the `total_loss` from this dictionary, calculates its mean using the `.mean()` method, and returns this value along with the full dictionary of losses and the updated state.

This function is crucial for training processes in reinforcement learning or similar frameworks where loss minimization is a primary objective. It provides both a scalar summary of the loss (`total_loss`) and detailed insights into different components of the loss calculation, facilitating further analysis and optimization.

**Usage Notes**

- **Performance Considerations**: The performance of `_loss` can be influenced by the size and complexity of the input data (e.g., rewards, discounts, observations). Efficient handling of large datasets or complex models may require optimizations such as vectorization or parallel processing.
  
- **Edge Cases**: Ensure that all input arrays (`rewards`, `discounts`, `observations`) are appropriately sized and aligned. Mismatches in dimensions can lead to runtime errors. Additionally, handle cases where the `total_loss` might be undefined (e.g., due to division by zero) by implementing appropriate checks or defaults.

- **Limitations**: The function assumes that the `loss_module` has an `apply` method capable of handling the provided parameters and inputs. If the module's behavior changes or additional parameters are required, `_loss` will need to be updated accordingly.
