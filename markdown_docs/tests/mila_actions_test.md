## ClassDef MilaActionsTest
**MilaActionsTest**: The function of MilaActionsTest is to test the conversion and mapping between DeepMind's action representation (DM actions) and MILA's action representation (MILA actions) in a strategic game, likely Diplomacy.

### Attributes

- **self**: The instance of the class.

### Code Description

The `MilaActionsTest` class inherits from `absltest.TestCase` and contains several test methods to ensure the correctness of action conversions between DM actions and MILA actions. These tests are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the game's logic, particularly in how actions are interpreted and executed.

#### 1. `test_inversion_dm_actions`

This method tests whether converting a DM action to a MILA action and back to DM actions includes the original DM action. It iterates through all possible DM actions, converts each to its corresponding MILA actions, and then checks if the original DM action is among the possible DM actions derived from each MILA action.

- **Process**:
  - For each DM action in `action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS`.
  - Convert the DM action to possible MILA actions using `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions`.
  - For each resulting MILA action, retrieve the possible DM actions using `mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions`.
  - Assert that the original DM action is in this list.

- **Purpose**:
  - Ensure that the conversion from DM to MILA and back is lossless and accurate.

#### 2. `test_inversion_mila_actions`

This method tests the reverse conversion: from MILA actions to DM actions and back to MILA actions, ensuring the original MILA action is included in the possible MILA actions derived from the DM action.

- **Process**:
  - For each MILA action in `action_list.MILA_ACTIONS_LIST`.
  - Convert the MILA action to possible DM actions using `mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions`.
  - For each DM action in this list, convert back to MILA actions using `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions`.
  - Assert that the original MILA action is in this list.

- **Purpose**:
  - Verify the accuracy and completeness of the conversion from MILA to DM and back.

#### 3. `test_all_mila_actions_have_dm_action`

This test ensures that every MILA action maps to at least one DM action.

- **Process**:
  - For each MILA action in `action_list.MILA_ACTIONS_LIST`.
  - Retrieve possible DM actions using `mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions`.
  - Assert that the list of DM actions is not empty.

- **Purpose**:
  - Prevent any MILA action from being invalid or unmappable to a DM action.

#### 4. `test_only_disband_remove_ambiguous_mila_actions`

This method checks that only 'disband' and 'remove' actions can have multiple corresponding DM actions, ensuring that ambiguity is limited to these specific types of actions.

- **Process**:
  - For each MILA action in `action_list.MILA_ACTIONS_LIST`.
  - Retrieve possible DM actions.
  - If there are more than one DM actions, ensure that the orders are either 'remove' or 'disband'.

- **Purpose**:
  - Maintain clarity and specificity in action mappings, allowing ambiguity only for specific action types.

#### 5. `test_all_dm_actions_have_possible_mila_action_count`

This test verifies that each DM action maps to a permissible number of MILA actions (1, 2, 3, 4, or 6), considering the variations in unit types and coast specifications.

- **Process**:
  - For each DM action in `action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS`.
  - Retrieve the list of corresponding MILA actions.
  - Assert that the number of MILA actions is one of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.

- **Purpose**:
  - Ensure that action mappings are manageable and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.

#### 6. `test_expected_number_missing_mila_actions`

This method tests that the MILA actions list does not include certain types of convoy actions that are considered invalid or irrelevant according to MILA's rules, matching expected counts for different categories of excluded actions.

- **Process**:
  - Track MILA actions derived from DM actions and categorize why some MILA actions are not in `action_list.MILA_ACTIONS_LIST`.
  - Count occurrences of different reasons for exclusion (e.g., long convoys, support for long convoys, etc.).
  - Compare these counts to expected values.

- **Purpose**:
  - Validate that the MILA action list correctly excludes specific types of convoy actions and that the number of exclusions matches expectations.

### Note

- **Dependencies**: This class relies on several modules and constants, including `absltest`, `action_list`, `mila_actions`, `action_utils`, and `human_readable_actions`. Ensure these are properly imported and defined.
  
- **Assertions**: The tests use assertions to validate conditions. If any assertion fails, the test will fail, indicating a problem in the action mapping logic.

- **Manual Checks**: Some parts of the code mention manual checks (e.g., "Manually checked that all of these are just long convoys"). Automated testing should aim to minimize reliance on manual verification; consider automating these checks if possible.

- **Code Readability**: The method names are descriptive, but some methods are quite long. Consider breaking down larger methods into smaller helper methods for better readability and maintainability.

- **Documentation**: While the test methods include docstrings, additional comments within the methods can help explain complex logic or assumptions.

- **Error Messages**: Custom error messages in assertions enhance debuggability by providing context when tests fail.

**Final Solution**

To ensure the accurate conversion and mapping between DeepMind's action representation (DM actions) and MILA's action representation (MILA actions) in a strategic game, the `MilaActionsTest` class is designed with several test methods. This class inherits from `absltest.TestCase` and focuses on verifying the correctness of action conversions.

### FunctionDef test_inversion_dm_actions(self)
**test_inversion_dm_actions**: This function tests whether converting a DeepMind (DM) action to a MILA action and back to a DM action recovers the original DM action.

**Parameters**: None

This is a unit test function, specifically designed to ensure the correctness of the conversion process between DeepMind actions and MILA actions. The function iterates through all possible DM actions, converts each one to its corresponding MILA actions, and then checks if converting back from each of these MILA actions includes the original DM action in the possible outcomes.

**Code Description**:

1. **Iteration over Possible Actions**: The function starts by iterating over all possible DM actions available in `action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS`. This ensures that the test covers every conceivable action that can be performed in the environment.

2. **Conversion to MILA Actions**: For each original DM action, it retrieves a list of possible MILA actions using the function `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions(original_action)`. This step simulates the transformation from the DM action space to the MILA action space.

3. **Back Conversion and Verification**: For each MILA action obtained in the previous step, the function checks if the original DM action is among the possible actions that can be recovered by converting back from the MILA action to DM actions using `mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions(mila_action)`. This ensures that the inversion process is accurate and that no information is lost or incorrectly transformed during the conversions.

4. **Assertion with Human-Readable Feedback**: If the original action is not found in the set of possible actions after the back conversion, the test fails with an assertion error. The error message provides clarity by including both the MILA action and a human-readable string representation of the original DM action, obtained through `human_readable_actions.action_string(original_action, None)`. This makes it easier to diagnose which specific action caused the failure.

This comprehensive testing approach helps maintain the integrity of the action conversion processes, ensuring that transformations between different action spaces are consistent and accurate.

**Note**: When running this test, it is crucial to ensure that all dependencies, such as `action_list`, `mila_actions`, and `human_readable_actions`, are correctly imported and functioning as expected. Any modifications to these modules may require revisiting this test to confirm that it still accurately reflects the intended behavior of action conversions.

### FunctionDef test_inversion_mila_actions(self)
**test_inversion_mila_actions**: This function tests whether converting a MILA action to a DeepMind (DM) action and back to MILA actions recovers the original MILA action.

**Parameters**: None

**Code Description**:

This function is part of a testing suite, specifically designed to verify the correctness of conversions between two types of action representations: MILA actions and DeepMind (DM) actions. The primary goal is to ensure that when a MILA action is converted to a DM action and then back to MILA actions, the original MILA action is included in the set of possible recovered actions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. **Iteration over Original Actions**:
   - The function iterates over each action in `action_list.MILA_ACTIONS_LIST`, which presumably contains a list of all defined MILA actions.

2. **Conversion to Possible DM Actions**:
   - For each original MILA action, it calls `mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions(original_action)` to get a list of possible corresponding DM actions.

3. **Checking Inversion for Each DM Action**:
   - For each DM action obtained in the previous step, it calls `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions(dm_action)` to get the set of MILA actions that could correspond to this DM action.

4. **Assertion Check**:
   - It asserts that the original MILA action is present in the set of MILA actions recovered from the DM action.
   - If the original action is not found in the recovered set, an assertion error is raised with a message indicating which DM action does not map back to the original MILA action.

This testing approach ensures that the conversion processes are inverses of each other, maintaining the integrity of the action representations across conversions.

**Note**:

- This function relies on several external components:
  - `action_list.MILA_ACTIONS_LIST`: The list of MILA actions to test.
  - `mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions()`: A function that maps a MILA action to possible DM actions.
  - `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions()`: A function that maps a DM action back to possible MILA actions.
  - `human_readable_actions.action_string()`: A function that provides a human-readable string representation of a DM action.

- The test is designed to be comprehensive, checking all possible conversions for each MILA action to ensure correctness.

- The use of assertions makes this function suitable for automated testing frameworks, where failed assertions can be caught and reported.

- This type of test is crucial in environments where action representations are transformed between different formats or platforms, ensuring that information is preserved across these transformations.

### FunctionDef test_all_mila_actions_have_dm_action(self)
**test_all_mila_actions_have_dm_action**: This function tests that every action in the MILA_ACTIONS_LIST has at least one corresponding dm_action.

**Parameters**: None

**Code Description**:

This function iterates through each action in the `MILA_ACTIONS_LIST` defined in the `action_list` module. For each action, it calls the function `mila_action_to_possible_actions` from the `mila_actions` module, passing the current mila_action as an argument. This function is expected to return a list of possible dm_actions corresponding to the given mila_action.

The function then uses the `assertNotEmpty` method to check that the list of dm_actions returned is not empty. If the list is empty, the assertion fails, and an error message is generated indicating which mila_action does not have any corresponding dm_action.

**Note**:

- Ensure that the `action_list.MILA_ACTIONS_LIST` contains all the necessary mila actions to be tested.

- The `mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions` function should be properly implemented to map each mila_action to its respective dm_actions.

- The `assertNotEmpty` method is likely a custom assertion method used to verify that a list is not empty. If this method is not part of a standard testing framework, ensure it is correctly defined and imported in the test module.

- This test is crucial for validating that there are no mila actions without any corresponding dm_actions, which could indicate missing implementations or configuration errors.

### FunctionDef test_only_disband_remove_ambiguous_mila_actions(self)
**test_only_disband_remove_ambiguous_mila_actions**: This function tests that only disband and remove actions are considered ambiguous MILA actions.

**Parameters**: None

**Code Description**:

This function iterates through a list of MILA actions defined in `action_list.MILA_ACTIONS_LIST`. For each MILA action, it retrieves the corresponding possible DeepMind (DM) actions using the function `mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions(mila_action)`. If there are more than one possible DM actions associated with a MILA action, it checks two conditions:

1. **Length Check**: Ensures that there are exactly two possible DM actions for ambiguous MILA actions. It uses `self.assertLen(dm_actions, 2, f'{mila_action} gives >2 dm_actions')` to assert that the length of `dm_actions` is exactly two. If not, it raises an assertion error with a message indicating which MILA action provides more than two DM actions.

2. **Action Type Check**: Checks that the orders within these DM actions are exactly "REMOVE" and "DISBAND". It extracts the order type from each DM action using `action_utils.action_breakdown(dm_action)[0]` and ensures that the set of orders is exactly `{action_utils.REMOVE, action_utils.DISBAND}`. If not, it raises an assertion error specifying that the MILA action is ambiguous but not a disband/remove action.

**Note**: This function is likely part of a testing suite to ensure that the mapping from MILA actions to DM actions is correctly handling ambiguity, specifically for disband and remove actions. It's important for maintaining the integrity of action mappings in environments where such actions are critical, possibly in a game or simulation context.

### FunctionDef test_all_dm_actions_have_possible_mila_action_count(self)
**test_all_dm_actions_have_possible_mila_action_count**: This function tests that each possible DM action corresponds to a specific number of MILA actions, ensuring correctness in action translation.

**Parameters**: None

**Code Description**:

This function iterates through all possible DM actions defined in `action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS` and checks that the number of corresponding MILA actions falls within an expected set {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}. This is crucial because DM actions can map to multiple MILA actions due to unspecified unit types or coasts, which are inferrable from the game board.

### Detailed Explanation

#### Purpose
The primary purpose of this function is to ensure that the translation from DM actions to MILA actions is correct and within expected bounds. DM actions may not specify certain details like unit type (army or fleet) or coast, as these can often be inferred from the game state. However, this ambiguity means that a single DM action can correspond to multiple MILA actions, each specifying these details explicitly.

#### How it Works
1. **Iteration over Possible Actions**: The function loops through each action in `action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS`. This list presumably contains all possible actions that can be taken in the game from the perspective of the DM (Diplomatic Messenger or similar entity).

2. **Translation to MILA Actions**: For each DM action, it calls `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions(action)` to get a list of corresponding MILA actions. MILA actions are likely more detailed versions of the DM actions, specifying all necessary details without ambiguity.

3. **Validation of Count**: It then checks if the number of MILA actions generated from a single DM action is in the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}. These specific numbers are chosen based on the possible combinations of unit types and coasts that can be inferred from the game board.

4. **Assertion**: If the count of MILA actions for any DM action is not in the expected set, the function raises an assertion error, providing a message that includes the DM action and the incorrect count of MILA actions.

#### Why These Specific Counts?
- **1**: Some DM actions might already specify all necessary details, leading to only one corresponding MILA action.
- **2**: This could occur when there are two possible unit types (army or fleet) for a single action.
- **3**: In cases where a province has two coasts and allows for different unit types, leading to three possible MILA actions.
- **4**: This might happen when an action involves two units, each with two possible specifications.
- **6**: A combination of multiple possibilities, such as two units each having three possible specifications.

#### Importance
Ensuring that DM actions translate correctly to MILA actions is vital for the game's mechanics, particularly in maintaining the integrity of game states and player intentions. This function acts as a safeguard to prevent bugs or logical errors in action handling that could otherwise go unnoticed until runtime.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that `action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS` is up-to-date and correctly defined, as any discrepancies here could lead to invalid tests. Additionally, understand that this function is part of a larger testing suite and should be run in a testing environment to catch any inconsistencies in action mapping.

### FunctionDef test_expected_number_missing_mila_actions(self)
**test_expected_number_missing_mila_actions**: This function tests that the MILA actions list does not miss any actions except for known convoy-related exceptions.

**Parameters:** None

**Code Description:**

This test function ensures that the MILA actions list, which is a subset of possible actions in a game (likely Diplomacy), correctly excludes only specific types of convoy actions that are not allowed or relevant according to MILA's rules. The function checks that no other actions besides these known exceptions are missing from the MILA actions list.

The function proceeds as follows:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Creates a defaultdict to map MILA actions to DeepMind actions.
   - Initializes a set to track long convoys.

2. **Mapping Actions:**
   - Iterates over all possible actions in `action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS`.
   - For each action, converts it to corresponding MILA actions using `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions(action)`.
   - Maps each MILA action to the original DeepMind action.
   - Tracks long convoys by checking if the MILA action is not in the MILA actions list and the order is a convoy to action.

3. **Categorizing Illegal MILA Actions:**
   - Initializes a dictionary to count reasons for illegal MILA actions.
   - Iterates over all MILA actions that are not in the MILA actions list.
   - Breaks down each action to determine the reason it's missing:
     - 'Long convoy to': For direct long convoys.
     - 'Long convoy': For convoys supporting long routes.
     - 'Other convoy': For irrelevant or partially relevant convoys.
     - 'Support long convoy to': For supports to long convoys.
     - 'Support alternative convoy too long': For supports to alternative long convoy routes.
     - 'Unknown': For any other unspecified cases.

4. **Verification:**
   - Compares the counted reasons against expected counts.
   - Uses an assertion to ensure that the observed counts match the expected counts, indicating that only known exceptions are missing from the MILA actions list.

**Note:**

- This test is crucial for maintaining consistency between the game's rules and the action representation used by MILA.
- It ensures that the MILA actions list correctly excludes only the specified types of convoy actions and includes all other possible actions.
- The function assumes that certain convoy actions are intentionally excluded from the MILA actions list due to rule differences or simplifications.
- Manual checks have been performed on the convoy actions to categorize them correctly, as indicated in the comments.
