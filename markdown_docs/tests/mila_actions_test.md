## ClassDef MilaActionsTest
### Function Overview

The `calculateDiscount` function computes a discount amount based on the original price of an item and a specified discount rate. This function is commonly used in e-commerce applications where discounts are applied to products.

### Parameters

- **originalPrice**: A floating-point number representing the original price of the product before any discounts.
- **discountRate**: A floating-point number representing the percentage of the discount, expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.1 for 10%).

### Return Values

- **discountAmount**: A floating-point number representing the calculated discount amount.

### Detailed Explanation

The `calculateDiscount` function performs the following steps:

1. **Parameter Validation**:
   - The original price and discount rate are first validated to ensure they are non-negative numbers.
   
2. **Discount Calculation**:
   - The discount amount is computed by multiplying the original price by the discount rate.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The calculated discount amount is returned as a floating-point number.

#### Code Breakdown

```python
def calculateDiscount(originalPrice: float, discountRate: float) -> float:
    # Validate input parameters
    if not (isinstance(originalPrice, (int, float)) and originalPrice >= 0):
        raise ValueError("Original price must be a non-negative number.")
    
    if not (isinstance(discountRate, (int, float)) and discountRate >= 0 and discountRate <= 1):
        raise ValueError("Discount rate must be between 0 and 1 inclusive.")
    
    # Calculate the discount amount
    discountAmount = originalPrice * discountRate
    
    return discountAmount
```

### Interactions with Other Components

- **Interaction with Pricing Systems**: This function is often used in conjunction with a pricing system where it calculates discounts for products before applying them to the final price.
- **Integration with User Interface**: The calculated discount amount can be displayed on the user interface, showing the reduced price after applying the discount.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**:
  - Ensure that `originalPrice` and `discountRate` are valid numerical values. Invalid inputs will result in a `ValueError`.
  
- **Performance Implications**:
  - The function is simple and performs minimal operations, making it highly efficient for use in real-time applications.

- **Security Considerations**:
  - Ensure that the input parameters are sanitized to prevent injection attacks or other security vulnerabilities.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage of the calculateDiscount function
original_price = 100.0
discount_rate = 0.20

try:
    discount_amount = calculateDiscount(original_price, discount_rate)
    print(f"Original Price: ${original_price:.2f}")
    print(f"Discount Rate: {discount_rate * 100}%")
    print(f"Discount Amount: ${discount_amount:.2f}")
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)

# Output:
# Original Price: $100.00
# Discount Rate: 20%
# Discount Amount: $20.00
```

### FunctionDef test_inversion_dm_actions(self)
**Function Overview**
The `test_inversion_dm_actions` function tests whether converting a Discrete Motion (DM) action to Multi-Level Action (MILA) representation and back recovers the original DM action. This ensures that the conversion process is reversible, maintaining the integrity of the action data.

**Parameters**
- None: The function does not take any parameters or attributes directly from external sources. It uses predefined constants and functions within the project.

**Return Values**
- None: The function does not return any values; it performs assertions to validate its logic.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `test_inversion_dm_actions` method iterates through all possible DM actions defined in the `action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS`. For each original action, it converts the action to a MILA representation using the `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions(original_action)` function. It then checks if converting this MILA action back to its possible actions set includes the original DM action.

1. **Initialization**: The method starts by iterating over all possible DM actions defined in `action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS`.
2. **Conversion and Validation**:
    - For each original DM action, it uses the `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions(original_action)` function to obtain a list of MILA actions.
    - It then iterates through this list of MILA actions.
    - For each MILA action, it checks if the original DM action is included in the set of possible actions returned by `mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions(mila_action)`.
3. **Assertion**: The method uses `self.assertIn` to assert that the original DM action is found within the set of possible actions for each MILA action.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- The function interacts with the `action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS` and `mila_actions` module, which are assumed to be part of the project's internal structure.
- It relies on the `human_readable_actions.action_string(original_action, None)` function for generating human-readable action strings during assertion messages.

**Usage Notes**
- The method is designed to run as a test case within a testing framework. It should be called from a test runner that sets up the necessary environment and assertions.
- Precondition: Ensure that `action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS` and `mila_actions` are properly defined and imported before running this test.
- Performance Consideration: The method performs multiple conversions, which may impact performance if the number of possible actions is large. Optimizations could be considered for large-scale applications.
- Security Considerations: There are no security concerns specific to this function as it operates on predefined data structures.

**Example Usage**
```python
# Assuming the necessary imports and setup are in place
from mila_actions_test import MilaActionsTest

class TestMilaActions(MilaActionsTest):
    def test_inversion_dm_actions(self):
        """Tests converting a DM to MILA to DM action recovers original action."""
        for original_action in action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS:
            possible_mila_actions = mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions(original_action)
            for mila_action in possible_mila_actions:
                self.assertIn(
                    original_action,
                    mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions(mila_action),
                    f'{mila_actions} does not map to set including dm action '
                    f'{human_readable_actions.action_string(original_action, None)}'
                )
```

This example demonstrates how the `test_inversion_dm_actions` method can be integrated into a test class and run as part of a testing suite.

### FunctionDef test_inversion_mila_actions(self)
**Function Overview**
The `test_inversion_mila_actions` function tests whether converting a MILA (Mobilization and Interception Action) to its corresponding DM (Decision Making) action and then back to MILA results in the original MILA action.

**Parameters**
- **No Parameters**: The function does not take any parameters. It uses internal lists and functions defined elsewhere in the project.

**Return Values**
- **None**: This function does not return any value; it only performs assertions to validate its logic.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `test_inversion_mila_actions` method iterates through a list of MILA actions, converts each action to possible DM actions, and then checks if converting these DM actions back to MILA results in the original action. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by iterating over all `original_action` elements from the `action_list.MILA_ACTIONS_LIST`.
2. **Conversion to Possible DM Actions**: For each `original_action`, it calls `mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions(original_action)`. This function returns a list of possible DM actions that could correspond to the given MILA action.
3. **Validation Loop**: For each `dm_action` in the list of possible DM actions, it checks if converting this DM action back to a set of MILA actions includes the original action using `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions(dm_action)`.
4. **Assertion Check**: The function uses `self.assertIn(original_action, ...)` to ensure that the original MILA action is included in the set of possible MILA actions derived from the DM action.
5. **Error Message**: If an assertion fails, a detailed error message is provided indicating which DM action did not map correctly back to the original MILA action.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- The function interacts with `action_list.MILA_ACTIONS_LIST` and `mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions(original_action)` to perform its tests.
- It relies on the `human_readable_actions.action_string(dm_action, None)` function to generate human-readable error messages for assertion failures.

**Usage Notes**
- **Preconditions**: The method assumes that `action_list.MILA_ACTIONS_LIST` contains valid MILA actions and that the conversion functions (`mila_action_to_possible_actions` and `action_to_mila_actions`) are correctly implemented.
- **Performance Considerations**: The function may be slow if the list of MILA actions is large, as it involves multiple nested loops. Optimizations could be considered for performance-critical applications.
- **Security Considerations**: There are no direct security concerns in this method, but ensuring that input data and conversion functions are secure is important.

**Example Usage**
Here is a simplified example to illustrate how `test_inversion_mila_actions` might be used:

```python
class MilaActionsTest:
    def test_inversion_mila_actions(self):
        """Tests converting a MILA to DM to MILA action recovers original action."""
        for original_action in ["MILA1", "MILA2", "MILA3"]:
            possible_dm_actions = mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions(original_action)
            for dm_action in possible_dm_actions:
                self.assertIn(
                    original_action,
                    mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions(dm_action),
                    f'{human_readable_actions.action_string(dm_action, None)} '
                    f'does not map to set including mila action {original_action}'
                )
```

In this example, the test method iterates over a list of MILA actions and checks if converting each action through DM actions results in the original action.
***
### FunctionDef test_all_mila_actions_have_dm_action(self)
**Function Overview**
The `test_all_mila_actions_have_dm_action` function checks whether each MILA action in a predefined list has at least one corresponding DM (Decision Making) action.

**Parameters**
- None. The function operates on internal lists and attributes without requiring any input parameters.

**Return Values**
- None. This is a test method that asserts the presence of DM actions for all MILA actions, but does not return any value.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `test_all_mila_actions_have_dm_action` function iterates through each MILA action in the `MILA_ACTIONS_LIST`, which is presumably defined elsewhere in the project. For each MILA action, it calls the `mila_action_to_possible_actions` method from a `mila_actions` object to retrieve all possible DM actions associated with that MILA action.

The function then uses an assertion (`self.assertNotEmpty`) to check if the list of DM actions is not empty. If any MILA action does not have at least one corresponding DM action, the test will fail and raise an assertion error, providing a message indicating which MILA action lacks a DM action.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- The function interacts with the `MILA_ACTIONS_LIST` list, which should be defined in another part of the project.
- It also relies on the `mila_actions` object to provide the mapping from MILA actions to possible DM actions.

**Usage Notes**
- This test is intended for use during the development and testing phases of the project to ensure that all MILA actions have corresponding DM actions.
- The function assumes that `MILA_ACTIONS_LIST` and `mila_action_to_possible_actions` are correctly defined and accessible within the scope of this method.
- Performance considerations are minimal since the test iterates through a list and performs a simple assertion for each element.

**Example Usage**
```python
# Assuming MILA_ACTIONS_LIST is defined elsewhere in the project
MILA_ACTIONS_LIST = ['action1', 'action2', 'action3']

class MilaActionsTest:
    def test_all_mila_actions_have_dm_action(self):
        # Iterate through each MILA action and check for corresponding DM actions
        for mila_action in MILA_ACTIONS_LIST:
            dm_actions = mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions(mila_action)
            self.assertNotEmpty(dm_actions, f'mila_action {mila_action} has no dm_action')

# Example of a hypothetical mila_actions object with the method
class MilaActions:
    def mila_action_to_possible_actions(self, action):
        # Simulate returning DM actions for each MILA action
        if action == 'action1':
            return ['dm_action1', 'dm_action2']
        elif action == 'action2':
            return []
        else:
            return ['dm_action3']

# Running the test
test = MilaActionsTest()
test.test_all_mila_actions_have_dm_action()
```

In this example, the test will fail for `action2` because it has no corresponding DM actions. The assertion message would indicate that `mila_action action2 has no dm_action`.
***
### FunctionDef test_only_disband_remove_ambiguous_mila_actions(self)
**Function Overview**
The `test_only_disband_remove_ambiguous_mila_actions` function tests a specific condition in the MILA (Militarized Action) actions list, ensuring that ambiguous actions are correctly identified and categorized as either "disband" or "remove".

**Parameters**
- None. The method is an instance method of the `MilaActionsTest` class and does not accept any external parameters.

**Return Values**
- None. This function does not return a value; it asserts conditions to validate the behavior of the MILA actions list.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `test_only_disband_remove_ambiguous_mila_actions` function iterates through each action in the `MILA_ACTIONS_LIST`. For each action, it uses the `mila_action_to_possible_actions` method from the `mila_actions` module to determine all possible derived military actions (DM actions) that can be generated from the given MILA action.

1. **Initialization and Iteration**:
    - The function starts by iterating over each `mila_action` in the `MILA_ACTIONS_LIST`.

2. **Determine Possible Actions**:
    - For each `mila_action`, it calls `mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions(mila_action)` to get a list of possible derived military actions (DM actions).

3. **Check Ambiguity Condition**:
    - If the length of the DM actions list is greater than 1, indicating ambiguity in the action, the function proceeds with further checks.
    
4. **Assert Conditions**:
    - The function asserts that the number of DM actions is exactly two (`self.assertLen(dm_actions, 2)`).
    - It then uses a set comprehension to extract the first part (order) from each derived military action using `action_utils.action_breakdown(dm_action)[0]`.
    - Finally, it checks if these extracted orders are only "disband" and "remove" (`{action_utils.REMOVE, action_utils.DISBAND}`).

5. **Assertion Failure**:
    - If any of the assertions fail, an assertion error is raised with a descriptive message indicating which MILA action caused the failure.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- The function interacts with the `mila_actions` module to determine possible derived military actions.
- It also relies on the `action_utils` module for breaking down and extracting specific parts of each derived military action.

**Usage Notes**
- This test ensures that ambiguous MILA actions are correctly categorized as either "disband" or "remove".
- The function is part of a suite of tests designed to validate the behavior of MILA actions within the project.
- It should be run in the context of an automated testing framework, such as PyTest.

**Example Usage**
Here is a simplified example demonstrating how this test might be used:

```python
# Assuming action_list and mila_actions are properly imported

class MilaActionsTest:
    def test_only_disband_remove_ambiguous_mila_actions(self):
        for mila_action in action_list.MILA_ACTIONS_LIST:
            dm_actions = mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions(mila_action)
            if len(dm_actions) > 1:
                self.assertLen(dm_actions, 2, f'{mila_action} gives >2 dm_actions')
                orders = {action_utils.action_breakdown(dm_action)[0]
                          for dm_action in dm_actions}
                self.assertEqual(
                    orders, {action_utils.REMOVE, action_utils.DISBAND},
                    f'{mila_action} ambiguous but not a disband/remove action')

# Example usage within a test suite
import unittest

class TestMilaActions(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Setup any necessary environment or objects
        pass
    
    def test_disband_remove_ambiguous_actions(self):
        mila_test = MilaActionsTest()
        mila_test.test_only_disband_remove_ambiguous_mila_actions()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This example demonstrates how to set up and run the test within a typical testing framework.
***
### FunctionDef test_all_dm_actions_have_possible_mila_action_count(self)
**Function Overview**
The function `test_all_dm_actions_have_possible_mila_action_count` ensures that each possible Dark Matter (DM) action in the game corresponds to a valid number of MILA actions. This test checks whether the number of generated MILA actions for any DM action is within an expected range.

**Parameters**
- None: The method does not accept any parameters or attributes other than those inherent to its class context.

**Return Values**
- None: The function does not return any value; it only performs assertions on the data.

**Detailed Explanation**
The function iterates over all possible DM actions defined in `action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS`. For each action, it calls `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions(action)` to generate a list of corresponding MILA actions. It then checks if the length of this list is within an expected range: 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.

- **Logic Flow**:
  1. The function starts by iterating over each DM action in `action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS`.
  2. For each action, it calls the `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions` method to get a list of possible MILA actions.
  3. It uses an assertion (`self.assertIn`) to check if the length of this list is one of the expected values: 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.
  4. If any action does not meet this condition, the test fails with a descriptive error message.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- The function interacts with `action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS` to get all possible DM actions and with `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions` to convert each DM action into MILA actions.
- It relies on these components to ensure that the generated MILA actions are valid for testing purposes.

**Usage Notes**
- **Preconditions**: The function assumes that `action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS` contains all possible DM actions and that `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions` correctly converts each action into a list of MILA actions.
- **Performance Considerations**: While the test is designed to be thorough, it may become slow if there are many possible DM actions. Optimizing this function or using caching mechanisms could improve performance.
- **Security Considerations**: The function does not involve any security-sensitive operations and can be used in a secure environment without additional precautions.

**Example Usage**
```python
class MilaActionsTest:
    def test_all_dm_actions_have_possible_mila_action_count(self):
        """Ensures each DM action corresponds to a valid number of MILA actions."""
        for action in action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS:
            mila_actions_list = mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions(action)
            self.assertIn(len(mila_actions_list), {1, 2, 3, 4, 6},
                          f'action {action} gives {len(mila_actions_list)} '
                          'mila_actions, which cannot be correct')

# Example of running the test
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import unittest
    suite = unittest.TestLoader().loadTestsFromTestCase(MilaActionsTest)
    unittest.TextTestRunner(verbosity=2).run(suite)
```

This example demonstrates how to run the `test_all_dm_actions_have_possible_mila_action_count` method as part of a test suite.
***
### FunctionDef test_expected_number_missing_mila_actions(self)
### Function Overview

The `test_expected_number_missing_mila_actions` function tests whether MILA actions miss any actions except known convoy-related ones. It ensures that long convoys are not included in the MILA action list and verifies that certain convoy actions do not affect adjudication.

### Parameters

- **None**: The function does not take any parameters or attributes directly passed to it. Instead, it relies on global variables and predefined lists within the project.

### Return Values

- **None**: The function does not return any values. It performs assertions to validate the expected outcomes against actual results.

### Detailed Explanation

The `test_expected_number_missing_mila_actions` function operates by comparing actions from a list of possible actions (`POSSIBLE_ACTIONS`) with the MILA action list and identifying discrepancies. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - A dictionary `mila_actions_to_dm_actions` is initialized to map each MILA action to its corresponding DeepMind (DM) action.
   - An empty set `long_convoys` is created to store pairs of locations that form long convoys.

2. **Action Mapping and Classification**:
   - For each possible action in `POSSIBLE_ACTIONS`, the function converts it into a list of MILA actions using `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions(action)`.
   - Each MILA action is then mapped to its corresponding DM action.
   - If an action is not found in the MILA action list, additional checks are performed:
     - **Convoys**: The function breaks down each action into its components (order, p1, p2, p3).
       - If the order indicates a convoy and the pair of locations `(p1, p2)` or `(p2, p1)` is in `long_convoys`, it is added to a list for further validation.
     - **Non-Convoys**: For non-convoys, specific conditions are checked to ensure they do not affect adjudication.

3. **Validation and Assertions**:
   - A dictionary `expected_missing_actions` contains the expected actions that should be missing from the MILA action list.
   - The function asserts that each expected missing action is present in the identified discrepancies (`discrepancies`).

### Interactions with Other Components

- **Global Variables**: The function relies on global variables such as `POSSIBLE_ACTIONS`, `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions()`, and `expected_missing_actions`.
- **External Functions**: It uses predefined functions like `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions()` to convert actions.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**: Ensure that the `POSSIBLE_ACTIONS` list is correctly populated with all possible actions.
- **Performance Considerations**: The function iterates over each action, which can be computationally expensive for large lists. Optimize by reducing unnecessary checks or using more efficient data structures if performance becomes an issue.
- **Security Considerations**: The function does not handle security directly but relies on the integrity of input data and predefined lists.

### Example Usage

```python
# Assuming all necessary global variables are defined elsewhere in the codebase
from mila_actions import action_to_mila_actions  # Hypothetical module for conversion

def test_expected_number_missing_mila_actions():
    expected_missing_actions = {
        'expected_action_1': True,
        'expected_action_2': True,
        # Add more expected missing actions as needed
    }
    
    discrepancies = []  # This would be populated by the function's logic
    
    for action in POSSIBLE_ACTIONS:
        mila_actions = action_to_mila_actions(action)
        for mila_action in mila_actions:
            if mila_action not in MILA_ACTION_LIST:
                discrepancies.append(mila_action)
    
    assert len(discrepancies) > 0, "No discrepancies found"
    for expected_missing in expected_missing_actions:
        assert expected_missing in discrepancies, f"Expected missing action {expected_missing} not found"

test_expected_number_missing_mila_actions()
```

This example demonstrates how to set up and run the function, ensuring that all necessary checks are performed.
