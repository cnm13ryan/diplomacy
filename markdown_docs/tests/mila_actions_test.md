## ClassDef MilaActionsTest
**MilaActionsTest**: The function of MilaActionsTest is to verify the correctness and consistency of actions between DeepMind's (DM) action format and MILA's action format.

attributes: The attributes of this Class.
· No explicit attributes are defined for this class as it primarily consists of test methods that inherit from `absltest.TestCase`.

Code Description: The description of this Class.
MilaActionsTest is a subclass of `absltest.TestCase` designed to perform several tests ensuring the bidirectional conversion between DeepMind's (DM) action format and MILA's action format. Each method in the class represents a specific test case that checks different aspects of these conversions.

The first test, `test_inversion_dm_actions`, verifies that converting an action from DM format to MILA format and back to DM format recovers the original action. It iterates over all possible actions defined in `action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS`, converts each one to MILA actions using `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions`, and then checks if any of these MILA actions can be converted back to include the original DM action.

The second test, `test_inversion_mila_actions`, performs a similar check but in reverse. It starts with MILA actions from `action_list.MILA_ACTIONS_LIST`, converts them to possible DM actions using `mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions`, and then checks if converting these DM actions back to MILA actions includes the original MILA action.

The third test, `test_all_mila_actions_have_dm_action`, ensures that every MILA action has at least one corresponding DM action by checking that the list of possible DM actions for each MILA action is not empty.

The fourth test, `test_only_disband_remove_ambiguous_mila_actions`, checks that if a MILA action corresponds to more than one DM action, those DM actions must be either 'disband' or 'remove'. It verifies this by ensuring the set of orders from these DM actions contains only 'disband' and 'remove'.

The fifth test, `test_all_dm_actions_have_possible_mila_action_count`, confirms that each DM action can correspond to a specific number of MILA actions (1, 2, 3, 4, or 6). This is because some DM actions do not specify unit type or coast when it can be inferred from the board, leading to multiple possible MILA actions.

The final test, `test_expected_number_missing_mila_actions`, checks that any MILA action missing from `action_list.MILA_ACTIONS_LIST` falls into specific known categories related to convoy actions. It categorizes these missing actions and compares their counts against expected values to ensure no unexpected actions are omitted.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
This class is intended for testing purposes within a project that deals with action conversions between DeepMind's and MILA's formats in a game-like scenario, likely related to strategy games involving units and movements. The tests rely on predefined lists of possible actions (`action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS` and `action_list.MILA_ACTIONS_LIST`) and utility functions for breaking down and converting actions (`action_utils.action_breakdown`, `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions`, and `mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions`). Developers should ensure these dependencies are correctly implemented and up-to-date to maintain the validity of the tests.
### FunctionDef test_inversion_dm_actions(self)
**test_inversion_dm_actions**: The function of test_inversion_dm_actions is to verify that converting an action from DM (Domain Model) format to MILA (MILA Action) format and then back to DM format recovers the original action.

parameters: This Function does not take any parameters.
· No explicit parameters are defined for this function as it operates on predefined constants and lists within its scope.

Code Description: The description of this Function.
The function iterates over each possible action listed in `action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS`. For each original action, it converts the action to a list of possible MILA actions using the `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions` method. It then iterates through each MILA action in the resulting list and checks if the original DM action is included in the set of possible actions that can be derived from the MILA action by calling `mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions(mila_action)`. This check ensures that the conversion process is reversible, meaning that starting with a DM action, converting it to MILA format, and then back to DM format should yield an action set that includes the original action. If the original action is not found in the possible actions derived from the MILA action, an assertion error is raised with a message indicating which MILA action does not map back to the expected DM action.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
This function relies on predefined lists and methods (`action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS`, `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions`, and `mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions`) that must be correctly implemented and available in the project for the test to function properly. The test assumes that the conversion between DM and MILA formats is bidirectional and lossless, which should be ensured by the implementation of the conversion methods. Additionally, the function uses `human_readable_actions.action_string` to generate a human-readable string representation of actions for error messages, so this method must also be correctly implemented.

### FunctionDef test_inversion_mila_actions(self)
**test_inversion_mila_actions**: The function of test_inversion_mila_actions is to verify that converting a MILA (MILA Instruction Language Action) to DM (Domain Model) actions and then back to MILA actions recovers the original MILA action.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· No explicit parameters are defined for this function. It operates using predefined lists and functions from imported modules.

**Code Description**: The description of this Function.
The function iterates over each action in `action_list.MILA_ACTIONS_LIST`, which is a list of MILA actions. For each original MILA action, it retrieves the possible DM actions that could be derived from it by calling `mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions(original_action)`. This function returns a list of potential DM actions corresponding to the given MILA action.

Next, for each DM action in the list of possible DM actions, the function checks if the original MILA action is included in the set of MILA actions that can be derived from this DM action. This check is performed using `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions(dm_action)`, which converts a DM action back into its corresponding MILA actions.

The assertion `self.assertIn(original_action, mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions(dm_action), ...)` ensures that the original MILA action is indeed one of the possible MILA actions derived from the DM action. If this condition fails for any DM action, an error message is generated using `human_readable_actions.action_string(dm_action, None)`, which provides a human-readable string representation of the DM action, along with the name of the original MILA action that was not recovered.

**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code
This function is specifically designed for testing purposes within a unit test framework. It relies on predefined lists and functions from other modules (`action_list.MILA_ACTIONS_LIST`, `mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions`, `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions`, and `human_readable_actions.action_string`). Ensure that these dependencies are correctly imported and initialized before running the test. The function does not return any value; it asserts conditions to verify the correctness of the conversion processes between MILA actions and DM actions.

### FunctionDef test_all_mila_actions_have_dm_action(self)
**test_all_mila_actions_have_dm_action**: The function of test_all_mila_actions_have_dm_action is to verify that each MILA action in the MILA_ACTIONS_LIST has at least one corresponding dm_action.

parameters: This Function does not take any parameters.
Code Description: The description of this Function involves iterating over a predefined list of MILA actions stored in `action_list.MILA_ACTIONS_LIST`. For each MILA action, it retrieves the possible dm_actions by calling the function `mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions(mila_action)`. It then asserts that the retrieved dm_actions are not empty, indicating that there is at least one dm_action associated with the given MILA action. If any MILA action does not have a corresponding dm_action, an assertion error will be raised with a message specifying which MILA action lacks a dm_action.
Note: Points to note about the use of the code include ensuring that `action_list.MILA_ACTIONS_LIST` and `mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions` are properly defined and accessible within the test environment. This function is designed to be used as part of a testing suite, specifically for validating the integrity of MILA actions and their associated dm_actions.
***
### FunctionDef test_only_disband_remove_ambiguous_mila_actions(self)
**test_only_disband_remove_ambiguous_mila_actions**: The function of test_only_disband_remove_ambiguous_mila_actions is to verify that any ambiguous MILA actions (those that can be resolved into more than one DM action) are specifically resolved into either a DISBAND or REMOVE action.

parameters: This Function does not take any parameters.
· parameter1: None
· parameter2: None

Code Description: The function iterates over each MILA action in the predefined list `action_list.MILA_ACTIONS_LIST`. For each MILA action, it converts it into possible DM actions using the `mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions` method. If a MILA action results in more than one DM action (i.e., it is ambiguous), the function asserts that there are exactly two resulting DM actions. It then extracts the primary order from each of these DM actions using `action_utils.action_breakdown`. The function checks if these orders are exclusively 'DISBAND' and 'REMOVE'. If any other combination of orders is found, an assertion error is raised with a message indicating that the MILA action is ambiguous but does not resolve to only DISBAND or REMOVE actions.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code include ensuring that `action_list.MILA_ACTIONS_LIST`, `mila_actions.mila_action_to_possible_actions`, and `action_utils.action_breakdown` are correctly defined and accessible within the test environment. This function is specifically designed for testing purposes, particularly in a context where MILA actions need to be resolved into unambiguous DM actions limited to DISBAND or REMOVE operations.
***
### FunctionDef test_all_dm_actions_have_possible_mila_action_count(self)
**test_all_dm_actions_have_possible_mila_action_count**: The function of test_all_dm_actions_have_possible_mila_action_count is to verify that each domain model (DM) action corresponds to a valid number of MILA actions, specifically ensuring that the count of possible MILA actions for any DM action falls within the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· This function does not take any explicit parameters. It operates on predefined data structures and constants.

**Code Description**: The description of this Function.
The function iterates over a list of possible actions defined in `action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS`. For each action, it converts the DM action into a list of MILA actions using the `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions` method. It then checks if the length of the resulting MILA actions list is one of the valid counts (1, 2, 3, 4, or 6). If the count does not match any of these values, an assertion error is raised with a message indicating which action caused the discrepancy and how many MILA actions were generated.

**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code
This function is designed to be part of a testing suite, specifically for validating the behavior of DM actions in relation to MILA actions. It relies on the correctness of `action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS` and the implementation of `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions`. Developers should ensure that these components are accurately defined and implemented to avoid false positives or negatives in the test results.
***
### FunctionDef test_expected_number_missing_mila_actions(self)
**test_expected_number_missing_mila_actions**: The function of test_expected_number_missing_mila_actions is to verify that the MILA actions list does not miss any actions except those known to be related to long convoys or irrelevant convoy actions.

parameters: This Function takes no parameters.
· parameter1: None
· parameter2: None

Code Description: The description of this Function involves iterating over all possible actions and converting them into MILA actions. It then checks if these MILA actions are present in the predefined MILA_ACTIONS_LIST. If an action is not found, it categorizes the reason for its absence based on whether it is a long convoy, other convoy-related action, or support for a long convoy. The function maintains a count of each category and compares it against expected counts to ensure that only known exceptions are missing from the MILA actions list.

The function starts by initializing a defaultdict `mila_actions_to_dm_actions` to map MILA actions back to their corresponding DeepMind actions and a set `long_convoys` to store long convoy routes. It then iterates over each action in `action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS`, converts it into MILA actions using `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions(action)`, and checks if these MILA actions are present in `action_list.MILA_ACTIONS_LIST`. If a MILA action is not found, the function breaks down the original DeepMind action to determine its type (e.g., CONVOY_TO, CONVOY, SUPPORT_MOVE_TO) and updates the corresponding count in the dictionary `reasons_for_illegal_mila_action`.

After processing all actions, the function defines a dictionary `expected_counts` with expected counts for each category of missing MILA actions. It then asserts that the actual counts match these expected values using `self.assertEqual`, ensuring that only known exceptions are missing from the MILA actions list.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
This function is specifically designed to test the integrity and completeness of the MILA actions list against a predefined set of possible actions. It relies on the accuracy of the `action_list.POSSIBLE_ACTIONS`, `mila_actions.action_to_mila_actions(action)`, and `action_utils.action_breakdown(action)` functions, as well as the correctness of the expected counts defined in `expected_counts`. Any changes to these underlying components may require updates to this test function. Additionally, the function assumes that all long convoys and other convoy-related actions have been manually verified for accuracy.
