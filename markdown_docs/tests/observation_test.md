## FunctionDef construct_observations(obs)
**construct_observations**: The function of construct_observations is to reconstruct utils.Observation from base-types.

parameters: 
· obs: element of the sequence contained in observations.npz.

Code Description: The function takes an ordered dictionary `obs` as input, which contains elements from a sequence stored in observations.npz. This file uses base types and numpy arrays for reference observations so that users can easily load and inspect its content. Inside the function, the 'season' key of the `obs` dictionary is converted into a `utils.Season` object using the value associated with it. The function then returns an instance of `utils.Observation`, constructed by unpacking the modified `obs` dictionary.

The function is utilized in two test methods within the ObservationTest class: `test_network_play` and `test_fixed_play`. Both tests involve running a Diplomacy game simulation using different policies (network-based policy for `test_network_play` and fixed play policy for `test_fixed_play`). After executing the game, the observations from the trajectory are compared against reference observations. The reference observations are first reconstructed into the expected Observation tuple format by calling `construct_observations`. This ensures that the structure of the observations matches what is required for accurate comparison.

Note: It is important to ensure that the input dictionary `obs` contains all necessary keys and values that correspond to the fields in the `utils.Observation` tuple. The 'season' key must be present, as it is specifically converted into a `utils.Season` object within this function.

Output Example: A possible return value of the function could look like an instance of `utils.Observation`, which might contain various attributes such as season, units, supply centers, etc., depending on how the Observation tuple is defined. For example:
```
Observation(season=Season(spring), units=[Unit(...)], supply_centers=[SupplyCenter(...)], ...)
```
## FunctionDef sort_last_moves(obs)
**sort_last_moves**: The function of sort_last_moves is to sort the last moves within each observation to ensure that test permutations are invariant.

parameters: 
· obs: A sequence of Observation objects where each Observation contains details about a game state including season, board, build numbers, and last actions.

Code Description: 
The function iterates over each observation in the provided sequence. For each observation, it constructs a new Observation object with the same season, board, and build numbers but with the last_actions list sorted. This sorting ensures that any permutation of the last actions within an observation does not affect the outcome of tests comparing observations. The function returns a new sequence of these newly constructed Observation objects.

The sort_last_moves function is used in both test_network_play and test_fixed_play methods within the ObservationTest class to ensure that the order of actions in the observations does not lead to false negatives in the comparison of expected and actual game states. This is particularly important when comparing sequences of observations from different runs or implementations where the order of actions might vary but the content should be equivalent.

Note: It is crucial that the last_actions attribute within each Observation object is a list of elements that can be sorted, such as strings or tuples, to avoid runtime errors during sorting. The function does not modify the original sequence of observations; instead, it returns a new sequence with the desired modifications.

Output Example: 
If the input sequence of observations contains an observation with last_actions = ['move A', 'move B'], the output will have this observation transformed to last_actions = ['move A', 'move B'] if already sorted or ['move B', 'move A'] if not, ensuring consistency across tests.
## ClassDef FixedPlayPolicy
**FixedPlayPolicy**: The function of FixedPlayPolicy is to provide a fixed sequence of actions for use in game simulations or tests.

attributes: 
· _actions_outputs: A sequence of tuples where each tuple contains a sequence of sequences of integers representing actions and any additional output.
· _num_actions_calls: An integer counter that tracks the number of times the `actions` method has been called.

Code Description: The FixedPlayPolicy class inherits from network_policy.Policy. It is designed to return a predetermined sequence of actions during game play, which can be useful for testing purposes or simulating specific scenarios. Upon initialization, it takes a parameter `actions_outputs`, which is a predefined list of action sequences and any associated outputs. Each call to the `actions` method returns the next set of actions from this list based on the `_num_actions_calls` counter, which increments with each call. The `reset` method does nothing in this implementation.

In the project, FixedPlayPolicy instances are used in two test methods within the ObservationTest class: `test_network_play` and `test_fixed_play`. In both tests, a FixedPlayPolicy instance is created using predefined action outputs obtained from `self.get_actions_outputs()`. This policy is then used alongside other policies (in the case of `test_network_play`, it is paired with a network_policy.Policy instance) to run a game simulation for a specified number of turns. The outcomes of these simulations are compared against reference data to verify correctness.

Note: FixedPlayPolicy should be initialized with a valid sequence of actions and outputs that aligns with the expected format during gameplay. Misalignment can lead to errors or unexpected behavior in the game simulation.

Output Example: When `actions` is called, it returns a tuple containing a sequence of sequences of integers representing the next set of actions and any additional output specified in `_actions_outputs`. For example, if `_actions_outputs` contains `[(([1, 2], [3]), None), (([4, 5], [6]), 'output')]`, the first call to `actions` will return `(([1, 2], [3]), None)` and the second call will return `(([4, 5], [6]), 'output')`.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, actions_outputs)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the FixedPlayPolicy class with specified actions outputs.

parameters: 
· actions_outputs: A sequence of tuples where each tuple contains a sequence of sequences of integers and any additional data (of type Any). This parameter represents the predefined actions and their associated outputs that the policy will use.

Code Description:
The __init__ method is the constructor for the FixedPlayPolicy class. It takes one parameter, `actions_outputs`, which is expected to be a structured input consisting of tuples. Each tuple in this sequence contains two elements: the first element is a sequence of sequences of integers, representing actions, and the second element can be any type of data (indicated by Any), which could represent additional information or metadata associated with those actions.

Upon initialization, the method assigns the `actions_outputs` parameter to an instance variable `_actions_outputs`. This allows the policy object to store and later access the predefined actions and their outputs. Additionally, it initializes another instance variable `_num_actions_calls` to zero. This variable is likely intended to keep track of how many times actions have been called or accessed through this policy instance.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
When creating an instance of FixedPlayPolicy, ensure that the `actions_outputs` parameter is correctly formatted as a sequence of tuples with the first element being a sequence of sequences of integers and the second element being any relevant data. Incorrect formatting may lead to errors or unexpected behavior when using the policy object in subsequent operations.
***
### FunctionDef __str__(self)
**__str__**: The function of __str__ is to return a string representation of the FixedPlayPolicy object.
parameters: This Function does not take any parameters.
Code Description: The __str__ method is a special method in Python used to define a human-readable string representation of an object. In this case, when the __str__ method is called on an instance of the FixedPlayPolicy class, it returns the string 'FixedPlayPolicy'. This method does not accept any arguments and simply provides a fixed string output.
Note: The use of the __str__ method allows for easy identification and representation of objects in print statements or logging, making debugging and user interaction more straightforward. It is important to note that this implementation always returns the same string regardless of the object's state or attributes.
Output Example: 'FixedPlayPolicy'
***
### FunctionDef reset(self)
**reset**: The function of reset is to initialize or reinitialize the state of the FixedPlayPolicy instance.

parameters: This Function does not accept any parameters.
· None

Code Description: The description of this Function indicates that it currently performs no operations, as denoted by the `pass` statement. This suggests that the method is intended to be overridden in a subclass where the actual reset logic would be implemented. The purpose of such a function typically includes resetting internal states or variables to their initial values, preparing the object for a new sequence of actions or observations.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code include understanding that this method does not perform any action at present and is expected to be extended in subclasses with specific reset behaviors. Developers should ensure that when overriding this method, all necessary state variables are appropriately reinitialized to maintain consistent behavior across different scenarios.
***
### FunctionDef actions(self, slots_list, observation, legal_actions)
**actions**: The function of actions is to return a predefined action output based on an internal counter.

parameters: 
· slots_list: A sequence of integers that appears to be unused within the function.
· observation: An instance of utils.Observation, which also seems to be unused in this method.
· legal_actions: A sequence of numpy arrays representing legal actions, but it is not utilized in the function.

Code Description: The function `actions` takes three parameters but only uses an internal attribute `_num_actions_calls` and a list `_actions_outputs`. It retrieves an action output from the `_actions_outputs` list at the index specified by `_num_actions_calls`, increments `_num_actions_calls` by one, and then returns the retrieved action output. The function ignores the `slots_list`, `observation`, and `legal_actions` parameters.

Note: Developers should ensure that the `_actions_outputs` attribute is properly initialized with a sequence of action outputs before calling this method. Additionally, the number of calls to `actions` should not exceed the length of `_actions_outputs` to avoid index errors.

Output Example: If `_actions_outputs` is initialized as `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`, and `actions` is called twice consecutively, the first call will return `[1, 2]` and the second call will return `[3, 4]`.
***
## ClassDef ObservationTest
**ObservationTest**: The function of ObservationTest is to serve as an abstract base class for testing observation-related functionalities in a Diplomacy game simulation.

attributes: The attributes of this Class.
· get_diplomacy_state: An abstract method that should return an instance of diplomacy_state.DiplomacyState.
· get_parameter_provider: An abstract method that loads params.npz and returns a ParameterProvider based on its content.
· get_reference_observations: An abstract method that loads and returns the content of observations.npz as a sequence of OrderedDicts.
· get_reference_legal_actions: An abstract method that loads and returns the content of legal_actions.npz as a sequence of numpy arrays.
· get_reference_step_outputs: An abstract method that loads and returns the content of step_outputs.npz as a sequence of dictionaries.
· get_actions_outputs: An abstract method that loads and returns the content of actions_outputs.npz as a sequence of tuples containing sequences of integers and any type.

Code Description: The description of this Class.
ObservationTest is an abstract base class designed to facilitate testing in a Diplomacy game simulation environment. It inherits from absltest.TestCase, which provides a framework for writing test cases in Python. The class uses the abc.ABCMeta metaclass to enforce that all subclasses implement certain methods.

The class defines several abstract methods that must be implemented by any subclass:
- get_diplomacy_state: This method should return an instance of diplomacy_state.DiplomacyState, which represents the state of a Diplomacy game.
- get_parameter_provider: This method loads params.npz and returns a ParameterProvider object. The ParameterProvider is responsible for managing parameters used in the simulation.
- get_reference_observations: This method loads observations.npz and returns its content as a sequence of OrderedDicts, which are used to compare with actual observations generated during the game.
- get_reference_legal_actions: This method loads legal_actions.npz and returns its content as a sequence of numpy arrays, representing the legal actions that can be taken in each state.
- get_reference_step_outputs: This method loads step_outputs.npz and returns its content as a sequence of dictionaries, which are used to compare with actual outputs generated during the game steps.
- get_actions_outputs: This method loads actions_outputs.npz and returns its content as a sequence of tuples containing sequences of integers and any type. These actions are used in fixed play policies.

The class also includes two test methods:
- test_network_play: This method tests whether the network loads correctly by playing 10 turns of a Diplomacy game using both a fixed policy and a network-based policy. It compares the generated observations, legal actions, and step outputs with reference data to ensure correctness.
- test_fixed_play: This method tests the user's implementation of a Diplomacy adjudicator by comparing the generated observations and legal actions with reference data when playing 10 turns of a game using only a fixed policy.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
Subclasses of ObservationTest must implement all abstract methods. The test methods rely on the correct implementation of these methods to function properly. Ensure that the paths to the .npz files are correctly specified in the implementations of get_parameter_provider, get_reference_observations, get_reference_legal_actions, get_reference_step_outputs, and get_actions_outputs.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
The output of test_network_play and test_fixed_play is not explicitly defined but would typically be an assertion error if any discrepancies are found between the generated data and the reference data. If no errors occur, the tests pass silently, indicating that the implementation matches the expected behavior.
### FunctionDef get_diplomacy_state(self)
**get_diplomacy_state**: The function of get_diplomacy_state is to return an instance of DiplomacyState.

parameters: The parameters of this Function.
· No explicit parameters are defined in the provided code snippet.

Code Description: The description of this Function.
The function `get_diplomacy_state` is designed to provide an instance of `DiplomacyState`. This method does not take any input parameters and returns a `DiplomacyState` object. In the context of the project, this function is utilized by two test methods within the `ObservationTest` class: `test_network_play` and `test_fixed_play`.

In both tests, `get_diplomacy_state` is called to initialize the game state for running simulations with different policies. Specifically:
- In `test_network_play`, it initializes the game state before playing 10 turns of a Diplomacy game using a combination of a fixed policy and a network-based policy.
- In `test_fixed_play`, it similarly initializes the game state but only uses a fixed policy for the simulation.

The returned `DiplomacyState` object is crucial as it encapsulates the rules, state transitions, and adjudication logic of the Diplomacy game. The correctness of this function directly impacts the validity of the tests, ensuring that the game mechanics are accurately represented in both scenarios.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
Developers should ensure that `get_diplomacy_state` is correctly implemented to return a valid and consistent `DiplomacyState` object. Any discrepancies or errors in this function could lead to failed tests, indicating issues with either the network loading or the internal game logic implementation.
***
### FunctionDef get_parameter_provider(self)
**get_parameter_provider**: The function of get_parameter_provider is to load parameters from a file and return a ParameterProvider instance based on its content.

parameters: This Function does not take any parameters.
Code Description: The get_parameter_provider method is designed to load parameters from a specified file, typically in the .npz format, and instantiate a ParameterProvider object using these parameters. Although the provided code snippet contains only a placeholder (pass), the expected implementation involves opening a file containing serialized network parameters, creating a ParameterProvider with this file, and then returning it. This method is crucial for initializing network handlers that require parameter data to function correctly.

In the context of the project, get_parameter_provider is called by the test_network_play method within the ObservationTest class. The returned ParameterProvider instance is used to initialize a SequenceNetworkHandler, which in turn is utilized by a Policy object. This setup is essential for testing the network's ability to load parameters and function correctly during gameplay simulations.

Note: Ensure that the file path provided to open the .npz file is correct and accessible within your environment. Incorrect paths or inaccessible files will result in runtime errors.
Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value would be an instance of ParameterProvider, initialized with data loaded from a specified .npz file. This object can then be used to manage and provide network parameters during gameplay simulations or other network-related operations.
***
### FunctionDef get_reference_observations(self)
**get_reference_observations**: The function of get_reference_observations is to load and return the content of observations.npz.

parameters: This Function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The method get_reference_observations is designed to load observation data from a file named 'observations.npz' and return it as a sequence of OrderedDict objects. Although the implementation details are not provided in the given code snippet, the docstring suggests that this function should open the specified file in binary read mode, use the dill library to deserialize the content, and then return the deserialized data. The expected output is a sequence (likely a list) where each element is an OrderedDict representing an observation.

In the context of the project, get_reference_observations plays a crucial role in two test methods: test_network_play and test_fixed_play. Both tests rely on this function to obtain reference observations that are used for comparison with the actual observations generated during game simulations. Specifically, these tests run games using different policies (network-based and fixed-play) and then use np.testing.assert_array_equal to verify that the simulated observations match the expected ones provided by get_reference_observations.

Note: It is essential to ensure that the 'observations.npz' file exists at the specified path and contains data in a format compatible with dill deserialization. Additionally, the structure of the returned sequence should align with what the test methods expect for accurate comparison.

Output Example: A possible return value from get_reference_observations could be:
[OrderedDict([('key1', value1), ('key2', value2)]), OrderedDict([('key1', value3), ('key2', value4)])]
***
### FunctionDef get_reference_legal_actions(self)
**get_reference_legal_actions**: The function of get_reference_legal_actions is to load and return the content of legal_actions.npz.

parameters: This Function does not take any parameters.
Code Description: The method get_reference_legal_actions is intended to load a file named 'legal_actions.npz' which contains data related to legal actions in a Diplomacy game. According to the provided sample implementation, it opens this file in binary read mode and uses the dill library to deserialize the content of the file into a Python object, typically expected to be a sequence of numpy arrays (Sequence[np.ndarray]). This method is crucial for comparing the legal actions generated during gameplay with predefined reference legal actions to ensure correctness. In the project, it is called by two test methods: `test_network_play` and `test_fixed_play`. Both tests run a Diplomacy game using different policies and then use `get_reference_legal_actions` to retrieve the expected sequence of legal actions for comparison against those generated during the game execution. This ensures that the game's adjudication process behaves as expected according to predefined rules.
Note: The actual implementation is currently marked with 'pass' and does not contain any code, so it needs to be filled in with the logic described in the sample implementation provided in the docstring.
Output Example: A possible return value of this function could be a list of numpy arrays, where each array represents legal actions for a specific state or turn in the game. For example:
[
  np.array([0, 1, 0]),
  np.array([1, 0, 1]),
  ...
]
***
### FunctionDef get_reference_step_outputs(self)
**get_reference_step_outputs**: The function of get_reference_step_outputs is to load and return the content of step_outputs.npz.

parameters: This Function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The get_reference_step_outputs function is designed to load data from a file named 'step_outputs.npz' and return its contents. According to the provided sample implementation, this function opens the specified file in binary read mode, loads the content using dill.load, and then returns the loaded data. This function is expected to return a sequence of dictionaries where each dictionary contains string keys mapped to any type of values.

In the context of the project, get_reference_step_outputs is called within the test_network_play method of the ObservationTest class. Specifically, it is used to retrieve reference step outputs for comparison with the actual step outputs generated during a simulated Diplomacy game run by the network_policy_instance and fixed_policy_instance policies. The function's output is compared against the trajectory.step_outputs using np.testing.assert_array_almost_equal with a precision of 5 decimal places.

Note: It is crucial that the file 'step_outputs.npz' exists at the specified path and contains data in a format compatible with dill.load for this function to work correctly. Additionally, ensure that the structure of the loaded data matches the expected sequence of dictionaries format to avoid errors during comparison in test_network_play.

Output Example: A possible return value from get_reference_step_outputs could be:
[{'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 123}, {'keyA': [456, 789], 'keyB': {'nestedKey': 'nestedValue'}}]
***
### FunctionDef get_actions_outputs(self)
**get_actions_outputs**: The function of get_actions_outputs is to load and return the content of actions_outputs.npz.

parameters: This Function does not take any parameters.

Code Description: The get_actions_outputs method is designed to read data from a file named 'actions_outputs.npz' and return its contents. Although the provided code snippet contains only a placeholder (pass statement) and a sample implementation in the docstring, it indicates that the function should open the specified file in binary read mode ('rb'), load its content using dill.load, and then return this loaded data. The expected return type is a sequence of tuples where each tuple consists of a sequence of sequences of integers and any other type (Any).

In the context of the project, get_actions_outputs plays a crucial role in providing predefined actions for testing purposes. It is called by two test methods within the ObservationTest class: test_network_play and test_fixed_play. Both tests utilize the returned data to instantiate a FixedPlayPolicy object, which is then used in game simulations to verify the correctness of network loading (in test_network_play) and the user's implementation of a Diplomacy adjudicator (in test_fixed_play).

Note: Ensure that the 'actions_outputs.npz' file exists at the expected path and contains data compatible with the dill.load method. The absence or incorrect format of this file can lead to runtime errors during the execution of tests.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```
[
    ([[1, 2], [3, 4]], {'key': 'value'}),
    ([[5, 6], [7, 8]], {'another_key': 'another_value'})
]
```
