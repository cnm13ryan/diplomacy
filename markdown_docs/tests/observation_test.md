## FunctionDef construct_observations(obs)
**construct_observations**: The function of construct_observations is to reconstruct utils.Observations from base-types.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· obs: an element of the sequence contained in observations.npz, which is expected to be a collections.OrderedDict object.
**Code Description**: This function takes an observation in its base-type form and converts it into a utils.Observation tuple. It does this by first converting the 'season' value in the observation to a utils.Season object, then using the updated observation dictionary to create a new utils.Observation object. The function is used in the tests/observation_test.py module, specifically in the test_network_play and test_fixed_play methods of the ObservationTest class, where it is used to reconstruct reference observations from base-types for comparison with actual observations generated during game trajectories.
**Note**: It's important to note that this function assumes that the input observation dictionary contains all necessary information to create a valid utils.Observation object. Additionally, the function relies on the utils module being properly imported and configured.
**Output Example**: A possible return value of this function could be a utils.Observation tuple containing the reconstructed observation data, such as (utils.Season('spring'), ...), where '...' represents other observation data.
## FunctionDef sort_last_moves(obs)
**sort_last_moves**: The function of sort_last_moves is to sort the last moves observation in a sequence of observations to make tests permutation invariant.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· obs: A sequence of utils.Observation objects, where each object contains information about a game state, including season, board, build numbers, and last actions.
**Code Description**: This function takes a sequence of observation objects as input and returns a new sequence with the last actions in each observation sorted. The sorting is done using the built-in sorted function in Python, which sorts the elements of a given iterable in a specific order - ascending or descending. In this case, the last actions are sorted in ascending order by default. The function uses a list comprehension to create a new sequence of observation objects with the sorted last actions. This is useful in tests where the order of the last moves does not matter, and the test should be permutation invariant.
The sort_last_moves function is used in two test cases: test_network_play and test_fixed_play. In both cases, it is used to sort the observations before comparing them with reference observations using np.testing.assert_array_equal. This ensures that the comparison is done correctly even if the order of the last moves is different between the actual and reference observations.
**Note**: The function assumes that the input sequence is not empty and that each observation object has a last_actions attribute that can be sorted. If these assumptions are not met, the function may raise an error or produce unexpected results.
**Output Example**: If the input sequence contains two observation objects with last actions [2, 1] and [3, 4], the output sequence will contain the same observation objects but with the last actions sorted: [1, 2] and [3, 4]. The actual output will be a list of utils.Observation objects with the sorted last actions.
## ClassDef FixedPlayPolicy
**FixedPlayPolicy**: The function of FixedPlayPolicy is to implement a fixed play policy in a game environment where actions are predetermined.
**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· _actions_outputs: A sequence of tuples containing sequences of integers and any other type, representing the predefined actions and their corresponding outputs.
· _num_actions_calls: An integer keeping track of the number of times the actions method has been called.

**Code Description**: The FixedPlayPolicy class is designed to provide a fixed sequence of actions in a game environment. It takes a sequence of actions and their corresponding outputs as input during initialization. The actions method returns the next action in the predefined sequence based on the current call count, effectively implementing a fixed play policy. This class is used in conjunction with other policies, such as network policies, to test and evaluate game environments. In the context of the project, FixedPlayPolicy is utilized by ObservationTest in methods like test_network_play and test_fixed_play to verify the correctness of the game environment and the implementation of the Diplomacy adjudicator.

**Note**: When using the FixedPlayPolicy class, it is essential to provide a valid sequence of actions and their corresponding outputs during initialization. Additionally, the class does not handle cases where the number of actions exceeds the predefined sequence length, as it simply increments the call count without bounds.

**Output Example**: The return value of the actions method could be a tuple containing a sequence of integers, such as ([1, 2, 3], None), representing the next action in the predefined sequence.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, actions_outputs)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the FixedPlayPolicy class.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· actions_outputs: A sequence of tuples containing sequences of integers and any type of object, representing the actions and their corresponding outputs.
**Code Description**: This function takes in a sequence of actions and their corresponding outputs, which is stored in the instance variable self._actions_outputs. It also initializes a counter self._num_actions_calls to keep track of the number of times an action is called, starting from 0. The purpose of this initialization is to set up the necessary data structures for the FixedPlayPolicy class to function correctly.
**Note**: When using this function, it is essential to provide a valid sequence of actions and outputs, as this will determine the behavior of the FixedPlayPolicy instance. The type hinting indicates that actions_outputs should be a Sequence of Tuples, where each tuple contains a Sequence of Sequences of integers and any type of object, ensuring that the input data conforms to the expected format.

The function does not take into account any specific attributes or properties of the FixedPlayPolicy object, and instead provides a generic string that can be used for identification or logging purposes.
**Note**: This function is typically used when a string representation of an object is required, such as when printing the object or displaying it in a user interface. It does not provide any detailed information about the object's state or properties.
**Output Example**: 'FixedPlayPolicy'
***
### FunctionDef reset(self)
**reset**: The function of reset is to define an action that takes no parameters and does not return any value.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function are none, as it does not accept any arguments.
· self: a reference to the current instance of the class

***
### FunctionDef actions(self, slots_list, observation, legal_actions)
**actions**: The function of actions is to return a predetermined action output based on the number of times it has been called.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· slots_list: A sequence of integers that is not used within the function.
· observation: An object of type utils.Observation that is not used within the function.
· legal_actions: A sequence of numpy arrays that is not used within the function.

**Code Description**: This function appears to be part of a class due to the use of self, which refers to the instance of the class. It maintains an internal counter, _num_actions_calls, to keep track of how many times it has been called. The function uses this counter to index into a list or other sequence, _actions_outputs, to retrieve the action output to be returned. After retrieving the action output, the function increments the _num_actions_calls counter. Despite having parameters for slots_list, observation, and legal_actions, these are not used within the function.

**Note**: The unused parameters suggest that this function may be part of a larger interface or inheritance structure where these parameters are required by other methods or classes but are not necessary for the specific implementation of actions in this context. Additionally, the reliance on an internal counter and predefined action outputs implies a deterministic behavior that does not depend on the input parameters.

**Output Example**: The return value is a tuple containing a sequence of sequences of integers and any type of object (represented by Any), such as ((1, 2, 3), None) or ((4, 5), "some_string"). The exact structure and content would depend on what has been predefined in _actions_outputs.
***
## ClassDef ObservationTest
**ObservationTest**: The function of ObservationTest is to provide an abstract base class for testing observations in a Diplomacy game environment.

**Code Description**: The ObservationTest class provides a framework for testing observations in a Diplomacy game environment. It defines several abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses to provide the necessary data for testing. The class includes two test methods: test_network_play and test_fixed_play. The test_network_play method tests the network loading by playing 10 turns of a Diplomacy game, while the test_fixed_play method tests the user's implementation of a Diplomacy adjudicator. Both methods use the abstract methods to load reference data and compare it with the actual output of the game.

The class uses various libraries, including absltest, abc, numpy, and diplomacy_state, to provide a robust testing framework. The abstract methods are designed to be implemented by subclasses, allowing for flexibility and customization in the testing process. The test methods use assertions to verify that the actual output matches the reference data, ensuring the correctness of the implementation.

**Note**: When using this class, it is essential to implement all the abstract methods in the subclass to provide the necessary data for testing. Additionally, the files used to load reference data (params.npz, observations.npz, legal_actions.npz, step_outputs.npz, and actions_outputs.npz) must be present in the correct location and format.

**Output Example**: The output of this class will depend on the implementation of its abstract methods and the test methods. However, a possible example of the output could be a series of assertions indicating whether the actual output matches the reference data, such as:
"Observations match: True"
