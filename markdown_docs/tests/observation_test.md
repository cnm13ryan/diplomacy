## FunctionDef construct_observations(obs)
**construct_observations**: The function of construct_observations is to reconstruct `utils.Observation` objects from base types.

**parameters**: This Function takes one parameter.
· obs: A single element from the sequence contained in observations.npz, which contains reference observations using base types and numpy arrays only.

**Code Description**: 
The `construct_observations` function plays a crucial role in reconstructing `utils.Observation` objects for testing purposes. It is called within test functions to ensure that the reconstructed observations match the expected format used by the tests. The function takes an element from the sequence stored in `observations.npz`, which contains base-type representations of observations, and converts it into a structured `utils.Observation` object.

The function performs the following steps:
1. **Season Conversion**: It first converts the 'season' field from its base type to an instance of `utils.Season`.
2. **Observation Construction**: Finally, it constructs a fully formed `utils.Observation` object using all fields in the input dictionary (`obs`) as keyword arguments.

This function is essential for ensuring that the test environment correctly interprets and processes observations as expected by the system under test. It aligns with other test functions such as `test_network_play` and `test_fixed_play`, which rely on these reconstructed observations to validate their behavior against reference data.

**Note**: Ensure that the input dictionary (`obs`) contains all necessary fields for constructing a valid `utils.Observation`. Any missing or incorrectly formatted fields may lead to errors during reconstruction.

**Output Example**: The function returns an instance of `utils.Observation` with all fields properly set. For example, given an input dictionary like:
```python
{'season': 'winter', 'player_id': 1, 'unit_positions': [[0, 0], [1, 1]], ...}
```
The output would be a fully constructed `utils.Observation` object with the same attributes and values.
## FunctionDef sort_last_moves(obs)
**sort_last_moves**: The function of `sort_last_moves` is to sort the last actions within each observation to ensure test permutation invariance.
**parameters**: This Function takes one parameter:
· obs: A sequence of `utils.Observation` objects.

**Code Description**: The function `sort_last_moves` processes a list of observations, where each observation contains information about a game state. Specifically, it sorts the last actions within each observation to ensure that any permutation in the order of these actions does not affect test outcomes. This is crucial for making tests more robust and reliable.

The function works by iterating over each `Observation` object in the input list `obs`. For each observation, it extracts the `last_actions`, sorts them using Python's built-in `sorted()` method, and then constructs a new `utils.Observation` object with the same season, board, build numbers, but with sorted last actions. The function returns a new list of these modified observations.

This sorting mechanism is particularly useful in test scenarios where the order of actions might vary due to different permutations or randomization, ensuring that tests remain consistent regardless of the order in which actions are processed.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the `utils.Observation` class and its attributes (`season`, `board`, `build_numbers`, `last_actions`) are properly defined. Also, note that sorting the last actions can significantly affect test results if the order is meaningful for the game logic; thus, it should be used judiciously.

**Output Example**: Given an input list of observations where each observation has a set of last actions, the function will return a new list of observations with the `last_actions` sorted. For example:

Input:
```python
[
    utils.Observation(season=1, board=['A', 'B'], build_numbers=[2, 3], last_actions=['C', 'D']),
    utils.Observation(season=2, board=['E', 'F'], build_numbers=[4, 5], last_actions=['G', 'H'])
]
```

Output:
```python
[
    utils.Observation(season=1, board=['A', 'B'], build_numbers=[2, 3], last_actions=['C', 'D']),
    utils.Observation(season=2, board=['E', 'F'], build_numbers=[4, 5], last_actions=['G', 'H'])
]
```

Note that the example output is identical to the input in this case because the `last_actions` were already sorted. However, if the `last_actions` were not sorted, they would be rearranged accordingly before being returned.
## ClassDef FixedPlayPolicy
**FixedPlayPolicy**: The function of FixedPlayPolicy is to execute predefined actions during a game simulation.
**attributes**: 
· _actions_outputs: A sequence of tuples containing sequences of integer arrays representing actions and additional outputs.
· _num_actions_calls: An integer counter used to keep track of the number of times the `actions` method has been called.

**Code Description**: The FixedPlayPolicy class is designed to simulate a policy that always returns predefined actions during a game. This can be particularly useful for testing purposes, where specific sequences of moves are expected and need to be enforced throughout the game simulation.

1. **Initialization (`__init__` Method)**:
   - The constructor takes a single parameter `actions_outputs`, which is a sequence of tuples. Each tuple contains two elements: a sequence of integer arrays representing actions and an additional output.
   - Upon initialization, the `_actions_outputs` attribute is set to the provided `actions_outputs`. Additionally, the `_num_actions_calls` counter is initialized to 0.

2. **String Representation (`__str__` Method)**:
   - This method returns a string representation of the class, which is simply 'FixedPlayPolicy'. It's useful for debugging and logging purposes.

3. **Reset Method**:
   - The `reset` method does not perform any operations and simply passes. This can be useful if you need to reset some state in other parts of your code but don't require it here.

4. **Actions Method (`actions` Method)**:
   - The `actions` method takes three parameters: `slots_list`, `observation`, and `legal_actions`.
   - It ignores the first two parameters (`slots_list` and `legal_actions`) as they are not used in this implementation.
   - The method accesses `_actions_outputs` using the current value of `_num_actions_calls`. This allows it to return a predefined action sequence for each call.
   - After returning an action, `_num_actions_calls` is incremented by 1, ensuring that subsequent calls will return different actions from the predefined list.

**Note**: When using FixedPlayPolicy in tests or simulations, ensure that `actions_outputs` contains the correct sequences of actions and additional outputs. The order in which these actions are called is crucial for the behavior of your game simulation.

**Output Example**: If `actions_outputs` is set to `[(np.array([1, 2]), 'output1'), (np.array([3, 4]), 'output2')]`, then on the first call to `actions`, it will return `(np.array([1, 2]), 'output1')`. On the second call, it will return `(np.array([3, 4]), 'output2')`. After that, it will start over from the beginning of the list.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, actions_outputs)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the state of the FixedPlayPolicy class instance.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: actions_outputs (Sequence[Tuple[Sequence[Sequence[int]], Any]])
   - This parameter expects a sequence of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements. The first element is a sequence of sequences of integers representing possible action outputs, and the second element can be any type, which might hold additional context or metadata related to these actions.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the FixedPlayPolicy class by setting up its internal state with the provided `actions_outputs`. The `_actions_outputs` attribute is assigned the value passed as `actions_outputs`, and a counter `_num_actions_calls` is initialized to zero. This method ensures that the policy has all necessary information to make decisions or generate actions based on the given inputs.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input provided to `actions_outputs` follows the specified structure, i.e., each element in the sequence should be a tuple containing two elements: a sequence of sequences of integers and another value of any type.
- The `_num_actions_calls` counter is initialized but not incremented or used within this method. It might be intended for tracking how many times actions are called during policy execution, which could be useful for debugging or logging purposes.
***
### FunctionDef __str__(self)
**__str__**: The function of __str__ is to return a string representation of the FixedPlayPolicy object.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: The `__str__` method is overridden to provide a human-readable string that represents an instance of the `FixedPlayPolicy` class. When this method is called, it returns the string `'FixedPlayPolicy'`. This can be useful for debugging or logging purposes where a clear and concise representation of the object is needed.
**Note**: Always ensure that the returned string accurately reflects the state or type of the object. In this case, the string 'FixedPlayPolicy' should uniquely identify the class to which the instance belongs.

**Output Example**: The output when calling `str(your_fixed_play_policy_instance)` would be `'FixedPlayPolicy'`.
***
### FunctionDef reset(self)
**reset**: The function of reset is to initialize or restart the state of the FixedPlayPolicy to its initial conditions.
**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.
· parameter1: None (The method takes no input arguments)
**Code Description**: 
The `reset` method in the `FixedPlayPolicy` class serves as an initializer for restarting the policy's internal state. Although it currently does not contain any specific logic, its primary purpose is to provide a clear and consistent way to reset the policy back to its initial state whenever needed.

This method is likely intended to be called at the start of each episode or when the environment requires the policy to begin anew. By having this method defined with no parameters, it ensures that the reset process can be standardized across different instances of `FixedPlayPolicy` without any external inputs affecting the outcome.

It's important for users to call this method appropriately in their code to ensure that the policy is properly initialized before being used or evaluated in a new context. This helps maintain consistency and correctness in how the policy behaves during different episodes or iterations.
**Note**: Users should ensure that `reset` is called at appropriate times, such as the beginning of each episode or when restarting an experiment. Failure to do so may result in the policy starting from an unexpected state, leading to incorrect behavior or results.
***
### FunctionDef actions(self, slots_list, observation, legal_actions)
**actions**: The function of actions is to generate action sequences based on the current observation and call count.
**parameters**: This Function takes three parameters:
· slots_list: An integer sequence representing the list of slots to be considered.
· observation: A utils.Observation object containing the current state or environment information.
· legal_actions: A sequence of numpy arrays indicating the legal actions for each slot.

**Code Description**: The function starts by ignoring the `slots_list` and `legal_actions` parameters, as they are marked as unused. It retrieves the next action output from the `_actions_outputs` list based on the current value of `_num_actions_calls`. After incrementing `_num_actions_calls`, it returns this retrieved action output.

The `_actions_outputs` list presumably contains pre-defined sequences of actions that the function will cycle through, and `_num_actions_calls` keeps track of how many times the function has been called to determine which sequence should be returned next. This mechanism can be useful for testing or simulating fixed behavior in an environment where different action sequences are needed at various points.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `_actions_outputs` is properly initialized with valid action sequences before this method is used.
- The `_num_actions_calls` attribute must also be set to a starting value if not already done so.
- This function assumes that the `utils.Observation` class and numpy are correctly imported.

**Output Example**: If `_actions_outputs` contains `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` and `_num_actions_calls` is initially set to `0`, then calling this method will return `[1, 2]`. On the next call, it would return `[3, 4]`, and so on.
***
## ClassDef ObservationTest
**ObservationTest**: The function of ObservationTest is to define a set of abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses for testing purposes.

**Code Description**: 
The `ObservationTest` class inherits from `absltest.TestCase` and is a test case class with an abstract base class (ABC) metaclass. This means it cannot be instantiated directly, but serves as a blueprint for other classes to implement specific methods for testing scenarios involving the `DiplomacyState`, parameters, observations, legal actions, step outputs, and action outputs.

1. **Abstract Methods**:
   - `get_diplomacy_state`: Returns an instance of `diplomacy_state.DiplomacyState` that represents the initial state of a Diplomacy game.
   - `get_parameter_provider`: Loads parameters from a file (e.g., `params.npz`) and returns a `parameter_provider.ParameterProvider` object. This method is essential for providing network weights or other necessary parameters to the test scenarios.
   - `get_reference_observations`, `get_reference_legal_actions`, `get_reference_step_outputs`, and `get_actions_outputs`: These methods load reference data from respective files (e.g., `observations.npz`, `legal_actions.npz`, `step_outputs.npz`, and `actions_outputs.npz`) and return them as structured data. The structure of these methods ensures that the test cases can compare the actual outputs with expected results.

2. **Test Methods**:
   - `test_network_play`: This method tests whether a network loads correctly by playing 10 turns of a Diplomacy game. It compares the observations, legal actions, and step outputs generated by the network against reference data.
   - `test_fixed_play`: This method verifies that the user's implementation of a Diplomacy adjudicator matches the expected behavior by comparing its output with pre-defined reference data.

**Note**: 
- The abstract methods must be implemented in any subclass to ensure that the test cases can execute properly. These methods should correctly load and return the necessary data structures.
- The `test_network_play` method assumes that the network policy instance behaves as expected and plays a game according to the rules defined by the user's implementation of `DiplomacyState`.
- The `test_fixed_play` method checks if the fixed play policy matches the expected behavior, ensuring consistency with the internal adjudicator.

**Output Example**: 
The output would typically consist of assertions that either pass or fail based on whether the actual outputs match the reference data. For instance:
```python
assert np.testing.assert_array_equal(
    sort_last_moves([construct_observations(o)
                     for o in self.get_reference_observations()]),
    sort_last_moves(trajectory.observations)) is None
```
This assertion would return `None` if all observations are correctly matched, or raise an AssertionError otherwise.
### FunctionDef get_diplomacy_state(self)
**get_diplomacy_state**: The function of get_diplomacy_state is to return an instance of diplomacy_state.DiplomacyState.

**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.

**Code Description**: The `get_diplomacy_state` method is responsible for obtaining the current state of a Diplomacy game. This method is crucial as it provides the initial or current state from which various tests and policies can operate within the game environment. In the context of the project, this method is called by two main test functions: `test_network_play` and `test_fixed_play`.

In `test_network_play`, the `get_diplomacy_state` method is used to initialize the state for running a sequence of network-based policies against fixed play policies. This setup allows testing whether the network's behavior matches the expected outcomes based on the internal Diplomacy adjudicator. The test ensures that both the network and the fixed play policies adhere to the rules and behaviors defined by the game.

Similarly, in `test_fixed_play`, the `get_diplomacy_state` method is utilized to set up the initial state for running tests against a fixed play policy. This helps verify if the user's implementation of the DiplomacyState class behaves as expected compared to the internal adjudicator used by the system.

By calling this method in these test functions, developers can ensure that their implementations are correct and consistent with the intended game mechanics.

**Note**: Ensure that the `get_diplomacy_state` method returns a valid instance of `diplomacy_state.DiplomacyState`. Any issues here could lead to failures in both `test_network_play` and `test_fixed_play`, indicating potential bugs or discrepancies in your implementation.
***
### FunctionDef get_parameter_provider(self)
**get_parameter_provider**: The function of get_parameter_provider is to load parameters from 'params.npz' file and return a ParameterProvider instance.
**Parameters**: None (The method does not accept any external parameters but uses internal attributes or methods provided by the class).
**Code Description**: This method opens 'params.npz' file, reads its content, and initializes a ParameterProvider object based on this data. The purpose is to provide the necessary parameters for network initialization as part of the test setup.

The get_parameter_provider method plays a crucial role in setting up the environment for testing the network's functionality. It ensures that all required parameters are correctly loaded before running tests. This method is called within the test_network_play method, which simulates a Diplomacy game using both fixed and network policies to validate the network's correctness.

The get_parameter_provider method follows a typical pattern where it first opens a file (in this case, 'params.npz'), then processes its contents to create an instance of ParameterProvider. This approach ensures that the parameters are correctly loaded and can be used throughout the testing process.

**Note**: Ensure that the path to 'params.npz' is correct and accessible within the environment where tests are run. Any issues with file access or incorrect parameter loading could lead to test failures.
**Output Example**: The method returns an instance of ParameterProvider, which contains all necessary parameters loaded from 'params.npz'. This output is then used by other methods such as SequenceNetworkHandler to initialize network handlers for testing purposes.
***
### FunctionDef get_reference_observations(self)
**get_reference_observations**: The function of get_reference_observations is to load and return the content from observations.npz.

**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.
- None

**Code Description**: 
The `get_reference_observations` method is responsible for loading data from a file named 'observations.npz' and returning it as a sequence of OrderedDict objects. The method currently contains a placeholder (`pass`) indicating that the actual implementation details are not provided in this code snippet.

This function serves as a critical component within the testing framework, providing reference observations against which other parts of the system can be compared. Specifically, `get_reference_observations` is called by two test methods: `test_network_play` and `test_fixed_play`.

In `test_network_play`, the method is used to retrieve the expected observations from 'observations.npz'. These observed values are then compared with those generated during a game simulation involving both fixed play policies and network policies. This comparison ensures that the network's behavior aligns with the expected outcomes.

Similarly, in `test_fixed_play`, the reference observations are loaded using `get_reference_observations` to verify that the user's implementation of the Diplomacy adjudicator behaves as intended by comparing its outputs against the pre-defined reference data. Any discrepancies would indicate a mismatch between the user’s implementation and the expected behavior.

**Note**: Ensure that 'observations.npz' is correctly placed in the specified path, and the file contains valid serialized data that can be loaded using `dill.load`. The method assumes that the file structure adheres to the expected format for easy deserialization into a sequence of OrderedDicts.

**Output Example**: A possible return value could be a list of dictionaries (represented as OrderedDicts), where each dictionary corresponds to an observation in the game. For example:

```python
[
    {'player0': 'A1', 'player1': 'B2', 'player2': 'C3'},
    {'player0': 'D4', 'player1': 'E5', 'player2': 'F6'}
]
```

This output represents a sequence of observations from the game, which can be used for validation purposes in the tests.
***
### FunctionDef get_reference_legal_actions(self)
**get_reference_legal_actions**: The function of get_reference_legal_actions is to load and return the legal actions defined by reference data.

**parameters**: 
· None

**Code Description**: This method is responsible for loading the content from a file named `legal_actions.npz` and returning it as a sequence of NumPy arrays. It serves as a baseline or reference against which other implementations can be compared, ensuring consistency in how legal actions are handled within the system.

The implementation provided in the docstring suggests that this function opens the specified file and uses Dill (a Python library for serializing objects) to load its contents into memory. These loaded contents are then returned as a sequence of NumPy arrays. This approach ensures that the reference data is easily accessible and can be used to validate other parts of the system.

This method is crucial because it provides a standardized way to check whether the legal actions generated by different components of the system (such as in `test_network_play` and `test_fixed_play`) match the expected behavior defined in the reference data. By comparing the output from these tests with the reference legal actions, developers can ensure that their implementations are correct.

**Note**: Ensure that the file path to `legal_actions.npz` is correctly specified in the production code, as this will be used by all test cases that rely on this method. Additionally, any changes to the reference data should be reflected here to maintain consistency across tests.

**Output Example**: The output of this function would be a sequence (list or tuple) of NumPy arrays, each representing a set of legal actions for a given state in the game. For example:

```python
[
  np.array([1, 2, 3]),
  np.array([4, 5, 6])
]
```

This output would be compared against the actual legal actions generated by the system under test to ensure correctness.
***
### FunctionDef get_reference_step_outputs(self)
**get_reference_step_outputs**: The function of `get_reference_step_outputs` is to load and return the content from `step_outputs.npz`.

**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The function `get_reference_step_outputs` is responsible for loading data stored in a file named `step_outputs.npz`. This file likely contains step-by-step outputs or results generated during some previous execution of the system. The function returns these contents as a sequence of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an output at a specific step.

The implementation provided within the docstring suggests that the function opens the specified file in binary read mode and uses `dill.load` to deserialize its content into a Python object. This deserialized object is then returned by the function. The use of `dill` instead of standard `pickle` allows for more complex data structures, including functions and classes, to be serialized and loaded.

This function plays a crucial role in ensuring consistency between different runs or configurations of the system. By loading reference outputs, it can be used to compare against current results to verify that the system is functioning as expected.

**Note**: Ensure that `step_outputs.npz` exists at the specified path before calling this function. If the file does not exist or cannot be opened, the function will fail silently due to the use of a pass statement. It's recommended to handle such cases appropriately in production code.

**Output Example**: The output could be a sequence of dictionaries, where each dictionary might contain information about the state at different steps during an execution. For example:

```python
[
    {'step': 0, 'output1': ..., 'output2': ...},
    {'step': 1, 'output1': ..., 'output2': ...},
    ...
]
```

Each dictionary in the sequence would represent a step's output, with keys corresponding to different types of outputs produced during the execution.
***
### FunctionDef get_actions_outputs(self)
**get_actions_outputs**: The function of get_actions_outputs is to load and return the content of actions_outputs.npz.
**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.
**Code Description**: The `get_actions_outputs` method is responsible for loading the data stored in the `actions_outputs.npz` file. It opens this file using binary read mode ('rb') and loads the contents into a Python object, which is then returned. This function is crucial as it provides the necessary data to other methods within the class that require access to these actions outputs.

In the context of the project, this method is called by two test methods: `test_network_play` and `test_fixed_play`. In both tests, the output from `get_actions_outputs` is used to initialize a `FixedPlayPolicy` object. The data returned by `get_actions_outputs` serves as a reference for comparing against the behavior of different policies during game simulations.

In `test_network_play`, the actions outputs are compared with the observations generated by running games using both a fixed policy and a network policy. This helps ensure that the network behaves correctly when making decisions based on these actions.

Similarly, in `test_fixed_play`, the actions outputs are used to verify that the user's implementation of the Diplomacy adjudicator matches the expected behavior by comparing the observations generated during game runs with the reference data.

The method is implemented as a placeholder function (`pass`), indicating that its actual implementation details need to be provided. The sample implementation provided in the docstring suggests using `dill.load` to load the contents of the file, which implies that the data stored might be serialized and requires deserialization before use.

**Note**: Ensure that the path 'actions_outputs.npz' is correctly specified and accessible from where this method is called. Any issues with file paths or permissions can lead to failure in loading the required data.

**Output Example**: The output of `get_actions_outputs` would typically be a sequence of tuples, where each tuple contains sequences of integers representing actions taken by players, along with additional metadata (if any) stored in the `.npz` file. For example:
```python
[
    ([1, 2, 3], 'metadata1'),
    ([4, 5, 6], 'metadata2')
]
```
This output is used to initialize policies and compare against reference data during game simulations.
