## FunctionDef bits_between(number, start, end)
**bits_between**: The function `bits_between` extracts bits from a given integer within specified start and end positions.

### Parameters

- **number (int)**: The integer from which bits are to be extracted.
- **start (int)**: The starting position (inclusive) of the bits to extract, with 0 being the least significant bit.
- **end (int)**: The ending position (exclusive) of the bits to extract.

### Code Description

The `bits_between` function is designed to extract a subset of bits from a given integer (`number`) based on specified start and end positions. This utility is particularly useful in scenarios where binary data needs to be parsed or manipulated at a bit level, such as in low-level programming, protocol decoding, or game development involving bitwise operations.

#### Functionality

The function calculates the value of bits between `start` and `end` positions in the binary representation of `number`. The positions are zero-indexed, with position 0 being the least significant bit (LSB). The range is inclusive of the start position and exclusive of the end position, similar to Python slicing conventions.

#### Implementation Details

1. **Masking Higher Bits**: 
   - `(1 << end)` calculates a value where the `end`-th bit is set to 1, and all lower bits are 0.
   - `number % (1 << end)` effectively masks all bits higher than `end - 1`, isolating the bits from 0 to `end - 1`.

2. **Shifting Lower Bits**:
   - `(1 << start)` calculates a value where the `start`-th bit is set to 1, and all lower bits are 0.
   - The result from the first step is then integer divided by `(1 << start)`, which shifts the bits to the right by `start` positions, effectively discarding the bits below the `start` position.

3. **Combining Steps**:
   - By combining these operations, the function isolates the bits between `start` and `end - 1` and returns their value as an integer.

#### Usage in Project

This function is utilized in several parts of the project to parse actions represented by integers, where different bits encode various pieces of information such as orders, province IDs, and coast indicators.

- **action_breakdown**: This function breaks down an action into its components: order, ordered province with coast indicator, target province with coast indicator, and a third province with coast indicator. It uses `bits_between` multiple times to extract specific bit ranges corresponding to each component.

- **is_waive**: Determines if an action represents a "waive" order by checking the order bits extracted using `bits_between`.

- **ordered_province**: Extracts the ordered province ID from an action using `bits_between`.

These uses demonstrate how `bits_between` facilitates the extraction of meaningful data from bitwise-encoded integers, making it a crucial utility function in handling action representations within the project.

### Note

- **Bit Positions**: Positions are zero-indexed, with position 0 being the LSB.
- **End Parameter**: The `end` parameter is exclusive, meaning bits from `start` up to but not including `end` are extracted.
- **Input Validation**: The function assumes that `start` and `end` are non-negative integers with `start < end`. No explicit validation is performed, so invalid ranges may lead to incorrect results.

### Output Example

Given `number = 42` (binary: 101010), `start = 1`, and `end = 4`:

- Bits between positions 1 and 4 are '010' (from right to left, starting at 0).
- The integer value of '010' is 2.

Thus, `bits_between(42, 1, 4)` returns `2`.
## FunctionDef actions_for_province(legal_actions, province)
Alright, I have this function called "actions_for_province" that I need to document. Let's see what it does.

So, the function is defined like this:

def actions_for_province(legal_actions: Sequence[Action], province: utils.ProvinceID) -> Sequence[Action]:

"""Returns all actions in legal_actions with main unit in province."""

actions = []

for action in legal_actions:

action_province = ordered_province(action)

if action and action_province == province:

actions.append(action)

return actions

Okay, it takes two parameters: legal_actions, which is a sequence of Action objects, and province, which is a ProvinceID from the utils module. It returns a sequence of Action objects.

From the docstring, it seems like the function is supposed to filter the legal_actions and return only those actions where the main unit is in the specified province.

Looking at the code, it initializes an empty list called "actions". Then, it iterates through each action in the legal_actions sequence. For each action, it calls another function called "ordered_province" to get the province associated with that action. It then checks if the action is truthy (which it probably always is, since it's an object) and if the action_province matches the given province. If both conditions are true, it appends the action to the actions list.

Finally, it returns the actions list.

So, essentially, this function filters a list of legal actions to find those that pertain to a specific province.

I need to make sure I understand what "ordered_province" does. From the previous documentation, I see that "ordered_province" extracts the province ID from an action's bitwise representation.

Given that, this function is filtering actions based on the main unit's province by extracting the province ID from each action and comparing it to the specified province.

I should also note that the function returns a sequence of actions, presumably for further processing or execution within the environment.

Possible use cases could be when a player or agent wants to see what actions are available in a particular province, or when the environment needs to restrict actions to a certain area.

I should also consider edge cases, like if legal_actions is empty, or if no actions match the province. In both cases, the function would return an empty list, which seems appropriate.

Another thing to consider is performance, especially if legal_actions is a large sequence. However, since this is likely used in a strategic game with a limited number of provinces and actions, it might not be a issue in practice.

In terms of error handling, the function doesn't seem to have any explicit checks for invalid inputs beyond the type annotations. It assumes that legal_actions is a sequence of Action objects and province is a valid ProvinceID.

I should also think about whether there are any potential improvements or optimizations. For example, using a list comprehension instead of a for loop for conciseness.

Like this:

return [action for action in legal_actions if action and ordered_province(action) == province]

This would make the function more concise without losing functionality.

Another consideration is that if "ordered_province" can return None or some invalid value, there might be a need to handle such cases. But based on the previous documentation, it seems "ordered_province" always returns a ProvinceID or a numpy array, so as long as action is a valid Action object, action_province should be valid.

I should also note that the function includes a check for "if action", which seems redundant because action is an object and should always be truthy unless it's None. Maybe there's a scenario where action can be None, but I need to verify that.

Assuming that legal_actions doesn't contain None values, this check might not be necessary.

In summary, "actions_for_province" filters a sequence of legal actions to find those associated with a specific province by extracting the province ID from each action using "ordered_province" and comparing it to the given province.

Now, I'll structure this into the required documentation format.

**actions_for_province**: This function filters a sequence of legal actions to return only those actions where the main unit is located in the specified province.

**Parameters**:

- legal_actions: Sequence[Action] - A sequence of legal action objects.

- province: utils.ProvinceID - The identifier of the province to filter the actions by.

**Code Description**:

This function is designed to filter a list of legal actions and return only those actions that are associated with a specified province. It achieves this by iterating through each action in the provided sequence of legal actions and checking if the main unit of the action is located in the given province.

The function utilizes another utility function called "ordered_province" to extract the province ID from each action's bitwise representation. It then compares this extracted province ID with the specified province ID. If they match, the action is included in the result list.

This functionality is crucial for scenarios where actions need to be restricted or viewed based on their association with specific provinces, such as in turn-based strategy games or simulations where provincial control is significant.

**Note**:

- Ensure that the legal_actions sequence contains valid Action objects.

- The "ordered_province" function is used internally to extract the province ID from each action.

- The function may return an empty list if no actions match the specified province.

**Output Example**:

Suppose we have a list of legal actions, and we want to find all actions related to ProvinceID 42.

actions = actions_for_province(legal_actions, 42)

# Assuming some actions are associated with ProvinceID 42

print(actions)  # Output: [Action1, Action2, ...]

In this example, "actions" would contain all actions from "legal_actions" where the main unit is in ProvinceID 42.

## Final Solution
To filter legal actions based on the main unit's province, the `actions_for_province` function is utilized. This function takes a sequence of legal actions and a specific province ID, then returns a list of actions that are associated with that province.

### Parameters
- **legal_actions**: Sequence[Action]  
  A sequence containing action objects that are legally permissible in the current game state.
  
- **province**: utils.ProvinceID  
  The identifier for the province to filter the actions by.

### Code Description
The function iterates through each action in the provided sequence of legal actions. For each action, it determines the associated province using the `ordered_province` utility function. If the action's province matches the specified province ID, the action is included in the result list.

This mechanism is essential for scenarios where game mechanics require actions to be restricted or viewed based on their association with specific provinces, such as in strategic games involving territorial control.

### Note
- Ensure that the `legal_actions` sequence contains valid Action objects.
- The `ordered_province` function is internally used to extract the province ID from each action.
- The function can return an empty list if no actions are found for the specified province.

### Output Example
```python
actions = actions_for_province(legal_actions, 42)
print(actions)  # Output: [Action1, Action2, ...]
```
In this example, `actions` will contain all actions from `legal_actions` where the main unit is located in ProvinceID 42.
## FunctionDef construct_action(order, ordering_province, target_province, third_province)
**construct_action**: The function `construct_action` is used to construct an action representation for a given order in a game, specifically in the context of diplomatic games like Diplomacy, where orders are issued to units located in provinces.

**Parameters:**

- **order:** An integer representing the type of order being executed. This could be actions like moving a unit to a target province, building a fleet, etc.

- **ordering_province:** A tuple representing the province from which the order is being issued. It includes the province's identifier and a flag indicating additional properties, such as coast location for coastal provinces.

- **target_province:** A tuple similar to `ordering_province`, representing the destination or target of the order. This could be where a unit is moving to or retreating to.

- **third_province:** Another tuple similar to the above, which might be used in orders that involve three provinces, such as convoying a unit from one province to another via a third province.

**Code Description:**

The function `construct_action` takes four parameters: an order and three province specifications (with flags), and constructs an action representation without an index. This representation is a bitwise combination of various components encoding the order and its related provinces.

1. **Initialization:**
   - A variable `order_rep` is initialized to 0. This will hold the final action representation.

2. **Encoding the Order:**
   - The order is encoded into `order_rep` by shifting it left by `ACTION_ORDER_START` bits. This positions the order type in the lower part of the representation.

3. **Encoding the Ordering Province:**
   - If `ordering_province` is not None, its province identifier is shifted left by `ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_START` bits and OR-ed into `order_rep`.
   - If the order is to build a fleet (`BUILD_FLEET`), the coast flag of the ordering province is also encoded by shifting it left by `ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_COAST` bits and OR-ing it into `order_rep`.

4. **Encoding the Target Province:**
   - If `target_province` is not None, its province identifier is shifted left by `ACTION_TARGET_PROVINCE_START` bits and OR-ed into `order_rep`.
   - If the order is to move to or retreat to a province (`MOVE_TO` or `RETREAT_TO`), the coast flag of the target province is also encoded by shifting it left by `ACTION_TARGET_PROVINCE_COAST` bits and OR-ing it into `order_rep`.

5. **Encoding the Third Province:**
   - If `third_province` is not None, its province identifier is shifted left by `ACTION_THIRD_PROVINCE_START` bits and OR-ed into `order_rep`.

6. **Return:**
   - The function returns the constructed `order_rep`, which is an integer representing the action without an index.

This bitwise encoding allows for a compact representation of actions, suitable for storage or transmission with minimal data overhead. Each component (order type, province identifiers, and flags) is placed in a specific bit position within the integer, ensuring that they do not overlap and can be extracted separately when needed.

**Note:**

- The function assumes that the constants `ACTION_ORDER_START`, `ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_START`, `ACTION_TARGET_PROVINCE_START`, `ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_COAST`, `ACTION_TARGET_PROVINCE_COAST`, and `ACTION_THIRD_PROVINCE_START` are defined elsewhere in the codebase. These constants define the starting bit positions for each component in the `order_rep` integer.

- The provinces are represented as tuples containing an identifier and a flag, likely indicating coastal locations or other properties relevant to the game's mechanics.

- The function handles different types of orders by conditionally encoding additional information, such as coast flags, based on the order type.

**Output Example:**

Suppose we have the following inputs:

- `order = 2` (假设 `BUILD_FLEET = 2`)

- `ordering_province = (5, 1)` (province ID 5, coast flag 1)

- `target_province = None`

- `third_province = None`

The function would construct `order_rep` as follows:

- Initialize `order_rep = 0`

- Encode order: `order_rep |= 2 << ACTION_ORDER_START` (假设 `ACTION_ORDER_START = 0`, 则 `order_rep = 2`)

- Encode ordering province: `order_rep |= 5 << ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_START` (假设 `ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_START = 4`, 则 `order_rep += 5 << 4 = 80`, so `order_rep = 82`)

- Since `ordering_province` is not None and order is `BUILD_FLEET`, encode coast flag: `order_rep |= 1 << ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_COAST` (假设 `ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_COAST = 8`, 则 `order_rep += 1 << 8 = 256`, so `order_rep = 338`)

- `target_province` and `third_province` are None, so no further encoding

- Return `order_rep = 338`

This is a mock example assuming specific values for the constants, which may differ in actual implementation.
## FunctionDef action_breakdown(action)
**action_breakdown**: The function `action_breakdown` decomposes an action, represented as a 32-bit or 64-bit integer, into its constituent parts: order, and three provinces each with their respective coast indicators.

### Parameters

- **action (Union[Action, ActionNoIndex])**: A bitwise-encoded integer representing an action. This can be either a 32-bit or 64-bit integer.

### Code Description

The `action_breakdown` function is designed to parse and extract specific components from a bitwise-encoded action integer. This function is crucial for interpreting actions in the context of the project, where actions are encoded into integers for efficiency and compactness.

#### Functionality

The primary purpose of this function is to break down the encoded action into its fundamental parts:

1. **Order**: An integer representing the type of order being executed.
2. **Provinces with Coast Indicators**: Each province is represented by a tuple containing the province ID and a coast indicator bit.

The function uses bitwise operations to isolate and extract these components from the action integer.

#### Implementation Details

The function relies on the helper function `bits_between` to extract specific bits from the action integer based on predefined start and end positions. These positions are constants that define where each component is stored within the action integer.

1. **Extracting the Order**:
   - The order is extracted using `bits_between` with parameters defined by `ACTION_ORDER_START` and `ACTION_ORDER_BITS`. This likely corresponds to a specific range of bits that encode the type of order.

2. **Extracting Provinces and Coast Indicators**:
   - Three provinces are extracted: ordered province, target province, and third province.
   - For each province, both the province ID and a coast indicator bit are extracted.
   - The province IDs are extracted using `bits_between` with starts and ends defined by constants like `ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_START` and `ACTION_PROVINCE_BITS`.
   - The coast indicator bits are extracted using similar bitwise operations, with their own start positions.

Each extracted province is represented as a tuple of `(province_id, coast_indicator)`, which are then returned along with the order.

#### Relationship with Callees

- **bits_between**: This utility function is heavily used within `action_breakdown` to extract specific bits from the action integer. It facilitates the parsing of the bitwise-encoded data by providing a way to isolate specific segments of the integer based on bit positions.

### Note

- **Bitwise Encoding**: Understanding the bitwise encoding scheme is crucial for using this function correctly. The positions and lengths of each component within the action integer are defined by constants such as `ACTION_ORDER_START`, `ACTION_PROVINCE_BITS`, etc.
- **Coast Indicator Bits**: These bits are not area IDs but specific indicators related to coastal provinces. Developers should be aware that these bits serve a different purpose from province IDs.
- **Action Types**: The order extracted is an integer between 1 and 13, representing different types of orders. Mapping these integers to their respective order types may be necessary for interpretation.

### Output Example

Suppose an action integer encodes the following:

- Order: 5
- Ordered Province: ID = 23, Coast Indicator = 0
- Target Province: ID = 47, Coast Indicator = 1
- Third Province: ID = 65, Coast Indicator = 0

The function would return:

```python
(5, (23, 0), (47, 1), (65, 0))
```

This tuple represents the order and the three provinces with their respective coast indicators.
## FunctionDef action_index(action)
**action_index**: The function of action_index is to return the index of an action among all possible unit actions.

**Parameters:**

- `action`: This parameter can be either an instance of the `Action` class or a NumPy array (`np.ndarray`). It represents the action for which the index needs to be determined.

**Code Description:**

The function `action_index` takes an action as input and returns its index among all possible unit actions. The action can be provided either as an object of the `Action` class or as a NumPy array. The function performs a bitwise right shift operation on the action by `ACTION_INDEX_START` positions to extract the index.

Here's a detailed breakdown of how the function works:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts two types of inputs:
   - An instance of the `Action` class.
   - A NumPy array (`np.ndarray`).

2. **Bitwise Operation**: It uses a bitwise right shift operation (`>>`) on the action by `ACTION_INDEX_START` positions. This operation effectively moves the bits of the action to the right by the specified number of positions, which helps in isolating the part of the action that represents its index.

3. **Return Type**: The return type is either an integer or a NumPy array, depending on the input type:
   - If the input is a single `Action` object, the output is an integer representing its index.
   - If the input is a NumPy array, the output is a NumPy array of integers, each representing the index of the corresponding action in the input array.

**Note:**

- Ensure that the `ACTION_INDEX_START` constant is properly defined and accessible within the scope of this function, as it is used to determine the number of positions to shift the bits.
- The function assumes that the action's index is stored in the higher bits of the action representation, which are shifted down to extract the index.
- If the input is a NumPy array, the operation is vectorized, meaning it applies the bitwise shift to each element of the array efficiently.

**Output Example:**

Suppose `ACTION_INDEX_START` is 3, and we have an `Action` object where the internal representation is 10 (binary 1010). Shifting right by 3 positions would result in 1 (binary 1), so the function returns 1.

If the input is a NumPy array `[8, 10, 12]` (binary `[1000, 1010, 1100]`), shifting each by 3 positions would result in `[1, 1, 1]`, assuming the index is stored in the higher bits as per the design.

**Potential Use Case:**

This function is likely used in environments where actions are encoded in a specific format, and their indices need to be extracted for further processing, such as logging, tracking, or mapping to action spaces in reinforcement learning scenarios.
## FunctionDef is_waive(action)
**is_waive**: The function `is_waive` determines whether a given action represents a "waive" order based on the bits that encode the order within the action.

### Parameters

- **action (Union[Action, ActionNoIndex])**: The action to check, which can be of type `Action` or `ActionNoIndex`. These types likely represent different structures or representations of actions within the project.

### Code Description

The function `is_waive` is designed to identify if a particular action corresponds to a "waive" order. This determination is made by examining specific bits within the action's binary representation that encode the order type.

#### Functionality

1. **Extract Order Bits**:
   - The function uses the helper function `bits_between` to extract the bits that represent the order from the action.
   - The parameters `ACTION_ORDER_START` and `ACTION_ORDER_BITS` define the starting position and the number of bits used to encode the order, respectively.

2. **Compare with WAIVE Constant**:
   - The extracted order value is compared to a constant `WAIVE`.
   - If the extracted order matches `WAIVE`, the function returns `True`, indicating that the action is a waive order; otherwise, it returns `False`.

#### Implementation Details

- **Bits Extraction**:
  - The `bits_between` function is crucial here as it allows precise extraction of bits from the action's binary representation.
  - By specifying the start position and the number of bits for the order, `bits_between` isolates the relevant bits to determine the order type.

- **Type Flexibility**:
  - The function accepts actions of type `Action` or `ActionNoIndex`, indicating flexibility in handling different action representations within the project.
  - This flexibility is likely due to different contexts or stages in the project where actions might or might not include indexing information.

#### Usage in Project

This function is part of a larger system that handles actions in a game or simulation environment, where actions are encoded in a bitwise manner for efficiency and compactness.

- **Action Representation**:
  - Actions are represented as integers where different bits encode various aspects such as order type, province IDs, and coast indicators.
  - This bitwise encoding allows for efficient storage and rapid parsing of action data.

- **Decision Making**:
  - The `is_waive` function is used to check if a particular action is a waive order, which could be significant for game logic, such as skipping turns or abandoning actions.

### Note

- **Bitwise Operations**:
  - Understanding bitwise operations is crucial for working with this function, as it relies on extracting specific bits from an integer representation of an action.
  
- **Action Types**:
  - The constants `ACTION_ORDER_START`, `ACTION_ORDER_BITS`, and `WAIVE` are assumed to be defined elsewhere in the project. Ensure that these constants are correctly set according to the action encoding scheme.

- **Type Union**:
  - The function accepts a union of `Action` and `ActionNoIndex` types. Depending on the implementation of these types, ensure that they can be appropriately handled by the `bits_between` function.

### Output Example

Suppose an action is represented as an integer where bits 0-2 represent the order type, and the waive order is encoded as 3 (binary '11').

Given an action integer: 10 (binary: 1010)

- `ACTION_ORDER_START = 1`
- `ACTION_ORDER_BITS = 2`

Extracting bits between positions 1 and 3 (`start=1`, `end=3`):

- Bits: '01' (from position 1 to 2)
- Integer value: 1

Since 1 does not equal `WAIVE` (假设为3), `is_waive` returns `False`.

Another action integer: 6 (binary: 0110)

- Extracted bits between positions 1 and 3: '11'
- Integer value: 3

If `WAIVE = 3`, then `is_waive` returns `True`.
## FunctionDef ordered_province(action)
Alright, I have this function called "ordered_province" that I need to document. Let's see what it does.

So, the function is defined like this:

def ordered_province(action: Union[Action, ActionNoIndex, np.ndarray]) -> Union[utils.ProvinceID, np.ndarray]:

return bits_between(action, ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_START,

ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_START+ACTION_PROVINCE_BITS)

Okay, it takes an "action" which can be of types Action, ActionNoIndex, or numpy array, and it returns either a ProvinceID or a numpy array.

First, I need to understand what an "action" is in this context. From the project structure, it seems like this is part of some environment or simulation, possibly related to strategy games or similar, given terms like "province" and "coast indicator."

Looking at the code, it's clear that actions are represented in a bitwise manner, where different bits encode various pieces of information such as orders, province IDs, and coast indicators.

The function "bits_between" is used here to extract specific bits from the action. It seems like ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_START defines the starting bit position for the ordered province information, and ACTION_PROVINCE_BITS defines how many bits are used to represent the province ID.

So, essentially, this function is extracting the province ID from the action's bitwise representation.

Let me think about how to structure this documentation.

First, I'll give a bold heading with the function name and a one-sentence description.

Then, I'll list the parameters with descriptions.

Next, a detailed code description explaining what the function does, how it works, and its role in the project.

After that, any notes on usage or considerations.

Finally, an output example to illustrate what the function returns.

Starting with the function name and description:

**ordered_province**: This function extracts the ordered province ID from an action's bitwise representation.

Now, parameters:

- action: Union[Action, ActionNoIndex, np.ndarray] - The action from which to extract the ordered province ID. It can be an Action object, an ActionNoIndex object, or a numpy array.

Next, code description:

This function is part of the action utilities module in the environment package. Its primary role is to parse the bitwise representation of an action and extract the identifier for the province that the action is ordered to affect.

In this project, actions are encoded into integers or arrays of integers, where different bits represent various aspects of the action, such as the type of order being issued, the province involved, and possibly other details like coast indicators. The "ordered_province" function focuses on extracting the province ID from this bitwise encoding.

The function uses the "bits_between" utility function to isolate the bits that correspond to the ordered province ID. The starting position for these bits is defined by the constant ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_START, and the number of bits used for the province ID is given by ACTION_PROVINCE_BITS. By extracting the bits in this range, the function can determine which province is specified in the action.

This functionality is crucial for interpreting actions within the simulation or game environment, allowing the system to understand which provinces are being targeted by various orders or commands.

In terms of usage, this function is called whenever there is a need to determine the target province of an action. For example, in functions like "actions_for_province," which filters legal actions for a specific province, or in "find_action_with_area," which searches for an action related to a given area.

It's important to note that the correctness of this function relies on the accurate definition of ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_START and ACTION_PROVINCE_BITS, as well as the consistent encoding of actions throughout the system. Any mismatch in these definitions could lead to incorrect province IDs being extracted.

Potential improvements or considerations might include adding input validation to ensure that the action parameter is of the expected type and format, or providing documentation on the bitwise structure of actions to facilitate easier maintenance and understanding of the code.

In summary, "ordered_province" is a vital utility function for extracting province IDs from encoded actions, enabling the environment to interpret and process actions effectively.

Moving on to notes:

- Ensure that the constants ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_START and ACTION_PROVINCE_BITS are correctly defined and match the encoding scheme used for actions.

- This function assumes that the action parameter is properly formatted; consider adding type checks or validation if necessary.

Finally, an output example:

Suppose we have an action encoded as an integer where bits 3 to 7 represent the ordered province ID. If ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_START is 3 and ACTION_PROVINCE_BITS is 5, then for an action value of 12345, the function would extract bits 3 to 7, which correspond to the province ID.

For instance:

action = 12345

binary representation: 11000000111001

Assuming ACTION_ORDERED_PROVINCE_START = 3 and ACTION_PROVINCE_BITS = 5

Bits 3 to 7: 00111 (which is 7 in decimal)

Therefore, ordered_province(action) would return 7, indicating province ID 7.

This example helps illustrate how the function extracts the relevant bits to determine the province ID from the action's bitwise representation.

Alright, that should cover the documentation for the "ordered_province" function. I've provided a clear description of its purpose, parameters, functionality, and an example of its output. This should be helpful for developers and beginners looking to understand and utilize this function effectively within the project.
## FunctionDef shrink_actions(actions)
**shrink_actions**: This function retains the top and bottom byte pairs of actions, specifically preserving the index, order, and ordered unit's area.

**Parameters:**

- `actions`: This parameter accepts action(s) in the format described at the top of this file. It can be a single action, a sequence of actions, or a NumPy array of actions.

**Code Description:**

The `shrink_actions` function is designed to process action data by retaining specific parts of the action representations. Actions are provided as input in a flexible format, which can be a single action, a sequence of actions, or a NumPy array. The function ensures that the input is treated uniformly by converting it into a NumPy array.

If the input actions array is empty, the function directly returns an empty array cast to integers. For non-empty arrays, the function performs bitwise operations to extract and combine specific byte pairs from each action.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Input Conversion:** The input `actions` are converted into a NumPy array for uniform processing.
2. **Empty Check:** If the array is empty, it is cast to integers and returned immediately.
3. **Bitwise Operations:**
   - **Top Byte Pair:** The top byte pair is extracted by shifting the action values right by 32 bits and then applying a bitwise AND operation with the inverse of 0xffff (`~0xffff`). This effectively retains the high-order bytes while zeroing out the lower bytes.
   - **Bottom Byte Pair:** The bottom byte pair is obtained by performing a bitwise AND operation with 0xffff on the original action values, which retains only the low-order bytes.
4. **Combination and Casting:** The extracted top and bottom byte pairs are combined by addition and then cast to 32-bit integers before being returned.

This function is essential for reducing the complexity or size of action representations while preserving critical information such as indices, orders, and unit areas, which are likely stored in the specific byte pairs being retained.

**Note:**

- Ensure that the input actions are in the correct format as described at the top of the file.
- Understand the significance of the byte pairs being retained to grasp the implications of using this function.
- This function modifies the action representations; use it only when you need to shrink actions while preserving specific data.

**Output Example:**

Suppose `actions` is a NumPy array containing action values like `[0x123456789ABCDEF0, 0xFEDCBA9876543210]`. After processing, the output might look like `[0x123400009ABC, 0xFEDC00007654]`, assuming the top and bottom byte pairs are retained and combined as per the function's logic.
## FunctionDef find_action_with_area(actions, area)
Alright, I have this function called "find_action_with_area" that I need to document. Let's see what it does.

So, the function is defined like this:

def find_action_with_area(actions: Sequence[Union[Action, ActionNoIndex]], area: utils.AreaID) -> int:

"""The first action in the list for a unit in this area. 0 if None exists."""

province = utils.province_id_and_area_index(area)[0]

for a in actions:

if ordered_province(a) == province:

return a

return 0

Okay, it takes two parameters: "actions" and "area", and returns an integer.

First, I need to understand what these parameters are.

"actions" is a sequence of either "Action" or "ActionNoIndex" objects. From the project structure, it seems like these are related to some kind of game or simulation where units can perform actions in different areas or provinces.

"area" is of type "utils.AreaID", which probably represents an identifier for a specific area in the game map.

The docstring says it returns the first action in the list for a unit in this area, and 0 if none exists.

Looking at the code, it first extracts the province ID from the area using "utils.province_id_and_area_index(area)[0]". So, it seems like each area is associated with a province, and possibly an index within that province.

Then, it iterates through the list of actions, and for each action, it checks if the "ordered_province" of that action matches the province ID extracted from the area. If it finds a match, it returns that action; otherwise, it returns 0.

I need to understand what "ordered_province" does. From the earlier documentation, I see that "ordered_province" extracts the province ID from an action's bitwise representation.

So, putting it all together, this function is looking for the first action in the list that corresponds to a unit in the specified area, identified by its province ID.

I should also consider edge cases and possible errors. For example, if the "actions" list is empty, it should return 0. If none of the actions correspond to the given area's province, it also returns 0.

It's important that the function returns the action itself, which is either an integer representing the action's bitwise encoding or possibly an object with more attributes.

Wait, the return type is specified as int, but in the code, it returns "a", which could be an Action object or an ActionNoIndex object, depending on the input sequence. There might be a mismatch here unless Actions are being represented as integers.

Looking back, in the earlier documentation for "ordered_province", it mentions that actions can be Union[Action, ActionNoIndex, np.ndarray], and it returns ProvinceID or np.ndarray. But in this function, it seems actions are either Action or ActionNoIndex, and the return type is int.

I need to make sure about the types here. Perhaps Actions are just integers, and ActionNoIndex are also integers, hence returning an int makes sense.

Also, the "area" parameter is of type "utils.AreaID", which likely is just an integer identifier for the area.

Let me think about how this function might be used in the project.

Suppose there are multiple units in different areas, and each unit can perform various actions. This function helps to find the first action that corresponds to a unit in a specific area.

For example, in a turn-based strategy game, players issue orders to units in different provinces. This function could be used to retrieve the action associated with a particular province.

Now, for the documentation, I need to structure it properly.

First, a bold heading with the function name and a one-sentence description.

Then, list the parameters with descriptions.

Next, a detailed code description explaining what the function does, how it works, and its role in the project.

After that, any notes on usage or considerations.

Finally, an output example to illustrate what the function returns.

Starting with the function name and description:

**find_action_with_area**: This function finds the first action in a list that corresponds to a unit in a specified area, returning 0 if no such action exists.

Now, parameters:

- actions: Sequence[Union[Action, ActionNoIndex]] - A sequence of actions, where each action can be an Action or ActionNoIndex object, representing operations performed by units.

- area: utils.AreaID - The identifier for the area to search for corresponding actions.

Next, code description:

This function is designed to identify the first action in a given list that is associated with a unit located in a specified area. It is part of the action utilities module in the environment package and plays a crucial role in filtering and retrieving relevant actions based on geographical locations within the game or simulation environment.

The function begins by extracting the province ID from the provided area using the "utils.province_id_and_area_index(area)[0]" method. This suggests that areas are organized within provinces, and the province ID is a key identifier for locating units and their associated actions.

It then iterates through each action in the provided sequence. For each action, it uses the "ordered_province(a)" function to retrieve the province ID associated with that action. If this province ID matches the one extracted from the area, the function immediately returns that action, assuming it is the first matching action in the list.

If no matching action is found after checking all actions in the list, the function returns 0, indicating that there is no action corresponding to a unit in the specified area.

This functionality is essential for managing and processing actions based on their geographical relevance, enabling the system to focus on specific areas of the game map and handle units accordingly.

In terms of usage, this function can be particularly useful in scenarios where operations need to be performed or queries made regarding units in particular areas. For example, it could be used to retrieve the action of a unit in a specific province for validation, execution, or reporting purposes.

It's important to note that the function assumes that actions are correctly encoded with their respective province IDs and that the area provided is valid and corresponds to an existing area in the game or simulation. Additionally, the efficiency of this function may depend on the length of the actions list, as it performs a linear search.

Potential improvements could include optimizing the search mechanism, especially if the actions list is large, or ensuring that actions are indexed or categorized by province for faster retrieval.

In summary, "find_action_with_area" is a utility function that efficiently retrieves the first action associated with units in a specified area, facilitating geographical-based action management within the environment.

Moving on to notes:

- Ensure that the "actions" sequence contains valid Action or ActionNoIndex objects with correct bitwise encoding.

- Verify that the "area" parameter is a valid AreaID and corresponds to an existing area in the game or simulation.

- Be aware that this function returns the action itself (likely an integer representation), not the index of the action in the list.

- If multiple actions correspond to the same area, only the first one encountered in the list is returned.

Finally, an output example:

Suppose we have a list of actions:

actions = [12345, 67890, 24680]

And an area with AreaID = 5.

Assuming that ordered_province(12345) corresponds to province ID 3, ordered_province(67890) to province ID 5, and ordered_province(24680) to province ID 5.

Given that the area with AreaID = 5 is associated with province ID 5, the function would return 67890, as it is the first action in the list that matches the province ID.

If none of the actions correspond to province ID 5, the function would return 0.

This example illustrates how the function identifies and returns the first action associated with the specified area based on province ID matching.

Alright, that should cover the documentation for "find_action_with_area". I've provided a clear description of its purpose, parameters, functionality, and an example of its output. This should be helpful for developers and beginners looking to understand and utilize this function effectively within the project.
Raw code:```
def find_action_with_area(actions: Sequence[Union[Action, ActionNoIndex]],
                          area: utils.AreaID) -> int:
  """The first action in the list for a unit in this area. 0 if None exists."""
  province = utils.province_id_and_area_index(area)[0]
  for a in actions:
    if ordered_province(a) == province:
      return a
  return 0
