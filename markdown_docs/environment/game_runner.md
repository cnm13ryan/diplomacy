## ClassDef DiplomacyTrajectory
**DiplomacyTrajectory**: The function of DiplomacyTrajectory is to store data from a Diplomacy game.
**attributes**: 
· observations: A list of utils.Observation objects representing the state of the game at each step.
· legal_actions: A list of numpy arrays containing the legal actions available for each player at each step.
· actions: A list of numpy arrays storing the actual actions taken by players at each step.
· step_outputs: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains outputs from policies during a step in the game.
· returns: An optional numpy array representing the outcome rewards of the game.

**Code Description**: The DiplomacyTrajectory class is designed to capture and store data generated during the execution of a Diplomacy game. It is used by the `run_game` function, which simulates a complete game from start to finish, recording key information at each step. Here's how it works in detail:

1. **Initialization**: The class initializes with empty lists for observations, legal actions, actions, and step outputs. The returns variable is set to `None`, indicating that the outcome of the game has not been determined yet.

2. **Appending Steps**: During the game simulation, after each turn, the `append_step` method is called. This method takes an observation (the current state of the game), legal actions (possible moves for each player), actual actions taken by players, and step outputs from policies as arguments. It appends these to their respective lists within the class.

3. **Termination**: Once the game ends either naturally or due to a predefined condition (such as reaching a maximum length or forcing a draw), the `terminate` method is called with the final returns value. This sets the `returns` attribute, marking the end of data collection for this trajectory.

The `run_game` function uses DiplomacyTrajectory to record every step of the game, from initial setup to conclusion, providing a comprehensive history that can be used for analysis or replay purposes.

**Note**: Ensure that the observations and actions are correctly formatted as utils.Observation objects and numpy arrays respectively. The step outputs should contain all necessary information generated by policies during their decision-making process.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of `DiplomacyTrajectory` might look like this:
```python
{
    'observations': [obs1, obs2, ..., obsN],
    'legal_actions': [legal_acts1, legal_acts2, ..., legal_actsN],
    'actions': [actions1, actions2, ..., actionsN],
    'step_outputs': [{'policy1_output': output1}, {'policy2_output': output2}, ..., {'policyM_output': outputN}],
    'returns': final_returns
}
```
Where `obsX` represents the state of the game at step X, `legal_actsX` are the legal actions for that step, `actionsX` are the actual moves made by players, and `outputX` contains detailed information from each policy's decision-making process. The `final_returns` value encapsulates the outcome rewards derived from the final state of the game.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize various attributes that will be used throughout the lifecycle of an instance of DiplomacyTrajectory.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters other than `self`.
**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method initializes several key attributes for the class `DiplomacyTrajectory`. These include:
- `observations`: A list to store observation data, where each element is an instance of `utils.Observation`.
- `legal_actions`: A list to store legal actions that can be taken at each step in the trajectory.
- `actions`: A list to record the actual actions taken during the trajectory.
- `step_outputs`: A list to hold output dictionaries from each step, which could include various information such as rewards or other metrics.
- `returns`: An optional numpy array to store cumulative returns over the trajectory.

This method sets up the structure for tracking and storing data related to a sequence of steps in a game of Diplomacy, allowing for detailed analysis and replay of gameplay sequences. By initializing these lists and variables, it prepares the instance to capture and process information throughout its lifecycle.
**Note**: Ensure that `utils.Observation` is properly defined elsewhere in your codebase, as this class is used directly here. Also, make sure to import required libraries such as `numpy` for handling the `np.ndarray` types.

**Output Example**: The method does not return any value; it initializes instance variables and sets up the data structures needed for storing game trajectory information. An example of how an instance might be initialized could look like this:

```python
# Assuming utils.Observation is defined elsewhere
obs = utils.Observation()
legal_action1 = np.array([0, 1])
action1 = np.array([2, 3])
step_output1 = {'reward': 5, 'info': {}}

diplomacy_trajectory_instance = DiplomacyTrajectory()

# After initialization:
diplomacy_trajectory_instance.observations == [obs]
diplomacy_trajectory_instance.legal_actions == [legal_action1]
diplomacy_trajectory_instance.actions == [action1]
diplomacy_trajectory_instance.step_outputs == [{'reward': 5, 'info': {}}]
```

### FunctionDef append_step(self, observation, legal_actions, actions, step_outputs)
**append_step**: The function of `append_step` is to add a new step's data into the trajectory of the game.

**parameters**:
· observation: An instance of `utils.Observation`, representing the current state or observation of the game.
· legal_actions: A NumPy array (`np.ndarray`) containing the legal actions available for each player at this turn.
· actions: A NumPy array (`np.ndarray`) storing the actual actions taken by players during this step.
· step_outputs: A dictionary (`Dict[str, Any]`) holding the outputs from policies or any other relevant information about this step.

**Code Description**: 
The `append_step` method is a crucial component of managing the game trajectory in the `DiplomacyTrajectory` class. This method updates the internal state by appending new data corresponding to each turn's progression, ensuring that the entire game history can be reconstructed and analyzed later. 

Here’s a detailed analysis:

1. **Observation Handling**: The `observation` parameter captures the current state of the game at this step. It is appended to the list of observations stored in `self.observations`. This allows tracking how the game evolves over time.

2. **Legal Actions Storage**: The `legal_actions` parameter contains information about what actions each player can take during their turn. These legal actions are recorded using `self.legal_actions.append(legal_actions)`, enabling reconstruction of the decision-making process for every step in the game trajectory.

3. **Actions Recording**: The `actions` parameter holds the actual decisions made by players at this specific turn. This data is stored with `self.actions.append(actions)`, providing a clear record of player choices and their impact on the game state.

4. **Step Outputs Documentation**: The `step_outputs` dictionary contains additional information such as policy outputs, which can be useful for analyzing decision-making processes or debugging purposes. It is appended to `self.step_outputs` using `self.step_outputs.append(step_outputs)`, ensuring that all relevant data from each step is preserved.

This method plays a pivotal role in maintaining the integrity of the game trajectory by systematically recording every turn's state, actions, and other pertinent information. This comprehensive logging mechanism supports detailed analysis and replay functionalities, which are essential for studying strategic decisions and outcomes in the game.

**Note**: Ensure that all input parameters are correctly formatted and aligned with expected types to avoid runtime errors. Proper validation of these inputs should be performed before calling `append_step` to maintain data consistency throughout the trajectory.
***
### FunctionDef terminate(self, returns)
**terminate**: The function of terminate is to finalize the trajectory by setting the returns attribute.

**parameters**: 
· parameter1: self - An instance of DiplomacyTrajectory.
· parameter2: returns - A dictionary containing the returns for each player, indicating their final scores or rewards after the game has ended.

**Code Description**: The `terminate` function is a crucial method in the `DiplomacyTrajectory` class. It is called at the end of the game to set the `returns` attribute based on the results calculated by the `run_game` function. This ensures that the trajectory object accurately reflects the outcome of the game, including each player's final score or reward.

In more detail, after the main loop in the `run_game` function has completed (either due to reaching a terminal state or the maximum number of turns), the `returns` attribute is set based on the current state of the game. If no explicit returns were calculated during the game (i.e., if `returns` remains `None`), then the final returns are derived from the `state`. The `terminate` method is then called to finalize the trajectory with these returns.

The relationship between this function and its caller, `run_game`, in the project context can be understood as follows: `run_game` manages the entire game process, including turns, actions, and state transitions. Once it determines that the game has ended (either due to a terminal state or reaching the maximum number of turns), it calls `terminate` on the resulting trajectory object to ensure all necessary data is captured.

**Note**: Ensure that the `returns` dictionary passed to the `terminate` function contains valid values for each player. If no returns are calculated during the game, make sure the `run_game` function correctly sets up and passes a meaningful `returns` value before calling `terminate`.

**Output Example**: The output of the `terminate` function is not directly observable as it modifies the internal state of the `DiplomacyTrajectory` object. However, after calling `terminate`, the `returns` attribute of the trajectory will be set to the provided dictionary containing each player's final score or reward. For example:

```python
trajectory.terminate({
    0: 123,
    1: -456,
    2: 789,
    3: -123,
    4: 567,
    5: -890,
    6: 234
})
```

This would set the `returns` attribute of the trajectory to a dictionary with each player's final score.
***
## FunctionDef _draw_returns(points_per_supply_centre, board, num_players)
**_draw_returns**: The function of _draw_returns is to compute returns (number of supply centers) when the game ends in a draw.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: points_per_supply_centre (bool) - Whether to assign points per supply centre in a draw (rather than 0/1 for win/loss).
· parameter2: board (np.ndarray) - The current state of the game board, representing provinces and their control status by players.
· parameter3: num_players (int) - The number of players participating in the game.

**Code Description**: 
The function `_draw_returns` calculates the returns for each player based on whether they have supply centres. If `points_per_supply_centre` is true, it assigns points to each player proportional to the number of supply centres they control. Otherwise, it assigns 1 point per supply centre controlled and 0 otherwise.

The function first checks if `points_per_supply_centre` is True. If so, it iterates through all players (from 0 to `num_players - 1`) and calculates the length of provinces controlled by each player using a utility function `utils.sc_provinces()`. These lengths represent the number of supply centres for each player.

If `points_per_supply_centre` is False, it uses a similar iteration but returns 1 if the player controls any supply centre and 0 otherwise. This method effectively gives a binary outcome for each player in terms of controlling at least one supply centre.

Finally, the function converts these results into an array of type `np.float32`, normalizes them by dividing by their sum to ensure they add up to 1 (useful for treating as probabilities), and returns this normalized array. This output can be used to determine each player's share in a draw scenario.

The `_draw_returns` function is called within the `run_game` method, which simulates an entire game of Diplomacy. It is invoked when specific conditions indicate that the game should end in a forced draw. The return values from `_draw_returns` are used to terminate the trajectory of the game with appropriate returns for each player.

**Note**: Ensure that the input parameters `points_per_supply_centre`, `board`, and `num_players` are correctly provided before calling this function, as incorrect inputs can lead to errors in the calculation. Also, be aware that the utility function `utils.sc_provinces()` must be defined elsewhere in your codebase.

**Output Example**: 
If there are 3 players and each player controls a different number of supply centres (e.g., Player 1: 5, Player 2: 3, Player 3: 2), and `points_per_supply_centre` is True, the output might be `[0.4615, 0.2789, 0.2600]`. These values are normalized such that they sum to 1, representing each player's share of the draw based on their supply centre count.
## FunctionDef run_game(state, policies, slots_to_policies, max_length, min_years_forced_draw, forced_draw_probability, points_per_supply_centre, draw_if_slot_loses)
