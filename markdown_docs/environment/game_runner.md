## ClassDef DiplomacyTrajectory
## Function Overview

**DiplomacyTrajectory** is a class designed to store and manage data from a game of Diplomacy, including observations, legal actions, taken actions, step outputs, and final returns.

## Parameters

The `DiplomacyTrajectory` class does not have any parameters in its constructor. However, it initializes several attributes:

- **self.observations**: A list that stores instances of `utils.Observation`, representing the state of the game at each turn.
- **self.legal_actions**: A list that stores numpy arrays (`np.ndarray`) containing legal actions available to players at each turn.
- **self.actions**: A list that stores numpy arrays (`np.ndarray`) of actions taken by players during each turn.
- **self.step_outputs**: A list that stores dictionaries (`Dict[str, Any]`) with outputs from the policies for each step.
- **self.returns**: An optional numpy array (`Optional[np.ndarray]`) that holds the final returns or outcomes of the game.

## Return Values

The `DiplomacyTrajectory` class does not return any values directly. Instead, it manages and stores data related to a game of Diplomacy throughout its lifecycle.

## Detailed Explanation

### Class Initialization

- **Attributes**:
  - `observations`: Initializes as an empty list to store observations from each turn.
  - `legal_actions`: Initializes as an empty list to store legal actions available at each turn.
  - `actions`: Initializes as an empty list to record the actions taken by players during each turn.
  - `step_outputs`: Initializes as an empty list to store outputs from policies for each step.
  - `returns`: Initializes as `None` and is set later when the game terminates.

### Methods

1. **append_step**:
   - **Purpose**: Appends data from a single step of the game to the respective lists.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `observation`: An instance of `utils.Observation` representing the current state of the game.
     - `legal_actions`: A numpy array (`np.ndarray`) containing legal actions available at this turn.
     - `actions`: A numpy array (`np.ndarray`) of actions taken by players during this turn.
     - `step_outputs`: A dictionary (`Dict[str, Any]`) with outputs from policies for this step.
   - **Logic**: This method appends the provided data to the respective lists (`observations`, `legal_actions`, `actions`, and `step_outputs`).

2. **terminate**:
   - **Purpose**: Sets the final returns or outcomes of the game.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `returns`: A numpy array (`np.ndarray`) representing the final results of the game.
   - **Logic**: This method assigns the provided `returns` to the `self.returns` attribute.

### Game Data Management

The `DiplomacyTrajectory` class is primarily used by the `run_game` function, which manages the game loop and calls `append_step` for each turn. After the game concludes, it calls `terminate` with the final returns.

## Usage Notes

- **Data Storage**: The class efficiently stores game data in lists, allowing for easy access and analysis after the game has ended.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If no actions are taken during a turn, an empty numpy array is appended to `actions`.
  - If there are no legal actions available, an empty numpy array is appended to `legal_actions`.
- **Performance Considerations**: The use of lists and numpy arrays ensures that data storage and retrieval operations are efficient. However, for very long games or high-frequency updates, memory usage may increase significantly.

### FunctionDef __init__(self)
## Function Overview

The `__init__` function initializes a new instance of the `DiplomacyTrajectory` class, setting up essential attributes to track observations, legal actions, taken actions, step outputs, and returns throughout a game trajectory.

## Parameters

- **self**: The instance of the `DiplomacyTrajectory` class being initialized. This parameter is implicitly passed when an object is created using the class constructor.

## Return Values

- None. The function initializes attributes within the instance and does not return any value.

## Detailed Explanation

The `__init__` function serves to establish a new game trajectory by initializing several key lists and one optional attribute:

1. **self.observations**: This list is intended to store instances of `utils.Observation`. Each observation represents the state of the game at a particular point in time, capturing all relevant information necessary for decision-making.

2. **self.legal_actions**: This list holds numpy arrays (`np.ndarray`) representing the set of legal actions available to players at each step of the trajectory. Legal actions are those that adhere to the rules of the game and can be taken from the current state.

3. **self.actions**: Another list of numpy arrays, `self.actions`, is used to record the actual actions taken by players during the game. Each action corresponds to a legal action chosen at a specific step.

4. **self.step_outputs**: This list contains dictionaries (`Dict[str, Any]`) that store outputs from each step of the game. The dictionary keys and values can vary depending on what information is deemed necessary to capture the outcome of each step.

5. **self.returns**: An optional numpy array (`Optional[np.ndarray]`) that may be used to store the returns or rewards associated with each step in the trajectory. Returns could represent scores, points, or other metrics indicating the success or failure of actions taken during the game.

The function does not perform any complex logic or calculations; it simply sets up these lists and attributes to ensure they are ready for use as the game progresses.

## Usage Notes

- **Initialization**: The `__init__` method is automatically called when a new instance of `DiplomacyTrajectory` is created. Developers should not call this method directly but rather instantiate the class using standard Python syntax (e.g., `trajectory = DiplomacyTrajectory()`).

- **Data Types**: Ensure that all data added to these lists adheres to the expected types (`utils.Observation`, `np.ndarray`, and `Dict[str, Any]`). Incorrect data types can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

- **Performance Considerations**: The use of lists for storing observations, actions, and step outputs is straightforward but may not be efficient for very large trajectories. Developers should consider using more memory-efficient data structures if the trajectory size becomes a concern.

- **Optional Attributes**: The `self.returns` attribute is optional and may remain `None` throughout the game if returns are not being tracked. This flexibility allows developers to customize the class according to their specific needs without modifying the core initialization logic.

### FunctionDef append_step(self, observation, legal_actions, actions, step_outputs)
### Function Overview

**append_step**: Appends a step's observation, legal actions, actions taken, and step outputs to their respective lists within a `DiplomacyTrajectory` instance.

### Parameters

- **observation (`utils.Observation`)**: The current state of the game as observed by all players.
- **legal_actions (`np.ndarray`)**: A NumPy array containing the legal actions available for each player at the current step.
- **actions (`np.ndarray`)**: A NumPy array containing the actions taken by each player during the current step.
- **step_outputs (`Dict[str, Any]`)**: A dictionary containing outputs from policies executed during the current step.

### Return Values

- None. The function modifies the `DiplomacyTrajectory` instance in place by appending data to its internal lists.

### Detailed Explanation

The `append_step` method is a core component of the `DiplomacyTrajectory` class, responsible for recording each step of a game of diplomacy. It captures and stores essential information about the game state at each turn, which can be used later for analysis or replay.

#### Logic and Flow

1. **Appending Observations**: The method starts by appending the current observation to `self.observations`. This observation reflects the state of the game board, including positions of units, supply centers, and other relevant information visible to all players.

2. **Recording Legal Actions**: Next, it appends the legal actions available to each player at this step to `self.legal_actions`. These actions are represented as a NumPy array where each element corresponds to a player's set of possible moves or decisions.

3. **Storing Player Actions**: The method then records the actions taken by each player during this step in `self.actions`. Similar to legal actions, these are stored as a NumPy array, with each entry corresponding to a playerâ€™s chosen action(s).

4. **Capturing Step Outputs**: Finally, it appends any outputs generated by policies during this step to `self.step_outputs`. This dictionary can contain various pieces of information such as policy decisions, confidence scores, or other relevant data.

### Usage Notes

- **Data Integrity**: Ensure that the provided `observation`, `legal_actions`, `actions`, and `step_outputs` are correctly formatted and correspond to the current game state. Incorrect data can lead to inconsistencies in the trajectory.
  
- **Performance Considerations**: The method appends data to lists, which is generally efficient for sequential operations. However, if the number of steps becomes very large, consider optimizing memory usage or using more efficient data structures.

- **Edge Cases**: If any of the input parameters are `None` or improperly formatted, it may lead to errors or unexpected behavior. Always validate inputs before calling this method.

By following these guidelines and considerations, developers can effectively use the `append_step` method to capture and manage game trajectories in a structured manner.

### FunctionDef terminate(self, returns)
## Function Overview

The `terminate` function is responsible for finalizing a game trajectory by setting its return values.

## Parameters

- **returns**: A sequence of values representing the outcome or result of the game. This parameter is used to update the internal state of the `DiplomacyTrajectory` object with the final results.

## Return Values

This function does not return any value; it modifies the `DiplomacyTrajectory` object in place by setting its `returns` attribute.

## Detailed Explanation

The `terminate` function is a simple method within the `DiplomacyTrajectory` class. Its primary purpose is to store the final results of a game into the trajectory object, which can then be used for analysis or further processing.

### Logic and Flow

1. **Parameter Assignment**: The function takes a single parameter, `returns`, which contains the final outcomes of the game.
2. **State Update**: It assigns this `returns` value to the `self.returns` attribute of the `DiplomacyTrajectory` instance, effectively storing the results within the trajectory object.

### Algorithms

- The function does not implement any complex algorithms or computations. It is a straightforward assignment operation.

## Usage Notes

- **Limitations**: This function assumes that the `returns` parameter provided is valid and correctly formatted according to the expectations of the `DiplomacyTrajectory` class.
- **Edge Cases**: If `returns` is `None`, it will overwrite any existing return values stored in the trajectory object. Ensure that `returns` always contains meaningful data relevant to the game's outcome.
- **Performance Considerations**: Since this function involves a simple attribute assignment, its performance impact is negligible. However, calling this function multiple times on the same trajectory object without reinitialization may lead to unexpected behavior.

This documentation provides a comprehensive understanding of the `terminate` function, ensuring that developers can effectively use and integrate it within their projects.

## FunctionDef _draw_returns(points_per_supply_centre, board, num_players)
**Function Overview**

The `_draw_returns` function computes the returns (number of supply centers) when a game ends in a draw.

**Parameters**

- `points_per_supply_centre`: A boolean indicating whether to assign points per supply center in a draw. If `True`, each player receives points based on their number of supply centers; if `False`, players receive either 0 or 1 point.
  
- `board`: A NumPy array representing the game board, which contains information about the supply centers controlled by each player.

- `num_players`: An integer specifying the number of players in the game.

**Return Values**

The function returns a NumPy array containing the normalized returns for each player. The normalization is done by dividing the raw returns (either the count of supply centers or 0/1 based on possession) by the sum of all returns, ensuring that the total sum of returns equals 1.

**Detailed Explanation**

The `_draw_returns` function determines how points are distributed among players when a game ends in a draw. The logic is as follows:

1. **Parameter Check**: The function receives three parameters: `points_per_supply_centre`, `board`, and `num_players`.

2. **Return Calculation**:
   - If `points_per_supply_centre` is `True`, the function calculates the number of supply centers each player controls using the `utils.sc_provinces(i, board)` method for each player `i`. The results are stored in a list called `returns`.
   - If `points_per_supply_centre` is `False`, the function assigns 1 point to players who control at least one supply center and 0 points to those who do not. This is achieved using a list comprehension that checks if `utils.sc_provinces(i, board)` returns any provinces for each player.

3. **Normalization**: The raw returns are then normalized by dividing each element in the `returns` list by the sum of all returns. This ensures that the total sum of the returns equals 1, providing a fair distribution of points among players.

4. **Return Statement**: Finally, the function returns the normalized returns as a NumPy array with a data type of `np.float32`.

**Usage Notes**

- The function assumes that the `board` parameter is correctly formatted and contains valid information about supply centers.
  
- If `num_players` does not match the actual number of players in the game, it may lead to incorrect results.

- Performance considerations are minimal since the function primarily involves list comprehensions and basic arithmetic operations. However, for very large boards or a high number of players, the performance could be impacted due to increased computation time.

- The function is intended to be used within the context of a larger game simulation, such as in the `run_game` function provided in the references, where it determines the final distribution of points when a draw occurs.
