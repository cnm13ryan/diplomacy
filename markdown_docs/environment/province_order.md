## ClassDef MapMDF
**MapMDF**: The function of MapMDF is to define different types of maps used in the game environment.

**Attributes**:
- STANDARD_MAP: Represents the standard map configuration.
- BICOASTAL_MAP: Represents the bi-coastal map configuration.

**Code Description**:

`MapMDF` is an enumeration class that defines different map configurations available in the game environment. It serves as a way to distinguish between various map layouts, each potentially affecting how the game is played or how certain features are arranged.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Definition and Purpose

- **Enum Definition**: `MapMDF` is defined using Python's `enum.Enum` class, which allows for creating enumerations with named constants. This makes the code more readable and less error-prone by providing clear labels for different map types.

- **Constants**:
  - `STANDARD_MAP`: Represents the default or standard map configuration, likely the most commonly used layout.
  - `BICOASTAL_MAP`: Represents an alternative map configuration that features a bi-coastal setup, possibly offering different strategic advantages or challenges.

#### Usage in Project

The `MapMDF` enumeration is utilized in several functions within the `province_order.py` module to handle different map configurations appropriately. Here’s how it is used in various contexts:

1. **get_mdf_content**:
   - This function retrieves content based on the specified map configuration.
   - It takes a `map_mdf` parameter of type `MapMDF`, defaulting to `STANDARD_MAP`.
   - Depending on the value of `map_mdf`, it returns different predefined content (`_STANDARD_MAP_MDF_CONTENT` or `_BICOASTAL_MAP_MDF_CONTENT`).
   - This allows for dynamic retrieval of map-specific data without hardcoding values.

2. **province_name_to_id**:
   - This function maps province names to their respective IDs based on the map configuration.
   - It uses `get_mdf_content` with the provided `map_mdf` to obtain the necessary content for processing.
   - The result is a dictionary where keys are province names and values are their corresponding IDs.

3. **province_id_to_home_sc_power**:
   - This function maps province IDs to the power (likely a political or military entity) that considers them as home strategic centers.
   - It specifically uses `MapMDF.STANDARD_MAP` to retrieve the map content, indicating that this mapping is only applicable or defined for the standard map.
   - The function parses the map content to build a dictionary associating each province ID with the power it belongs to.

4. **fleet_adjacency_map**:
   - This function creates a mapping of fleet adjacencies between areas, crucial for determining valid fleet movements in the game.
   - It uses `MapMDF.BICOASTAL_MAP` to retrieve the map content, suggesting that this adjacency mapping is specific to the bi-coastal map configuration.
   - The function processes the map content to build a dictionary where keys are area IDs and values are lists of adjacent area IDs for fleet movements.

#### Functional Relationships

- **Map Configuration Dependency**: Functions like `get_mdf_content`, `province_name_to_id`, and `fleet_adjacency_map` rely on the `map_mdf` parameter to adapt their behavior based on the selected map configuration. This modularity allows the game to support multiple map layouts without duplicating code.

- **Data Parsing and Mapping**: The enumeration enables clear differentiation between map types, which is essential for parsing and interpreting map-specific data correctly. For instance, province IDs and fleet adjacencies can vary significantly between different map configurations.

- **Default Behavior**: By setting default values to `MapMDF.STANDARD_MAP`, functions provide a consistent behavior when no specific map configuration is specified, ensuring compatibility with existing code that might not handle multiple map types.

#### Note

- **Correct Usage**: When using functions that accept `map_mdf` as a parameter, ensure to pass the appropriate `MapMDF` enum value to get the correct map-specific data. Incorrect mapping can lead to misinterpretation of game data and faulty gameplay mechanics.

- **Expansion Potential**: If new map configurations are added in the future, extending the `MapMDF` enumeration and updating dependent functions accordingly will be necessary. This design facilitates such expansions by providing a clear structure for managing different map types.

- **Error Handling**: Functions like `get_mdf_content` include error handling for unknown `map_mdf` values, raising a `ValueError` to prevent runtime errors due to invalid configurations. Ensuring comprehensive error handling is crucial when dealing with enumerations to maintain code robustness.

## FunctionDef get_mdf_content(map_mdf)
Alright, I have this function to document: `get_mdf_content`. It's part of a project, and I've got some context about how it's used and what other parts of the code it interacts with. My goal is to create clear and detailed documentation that will help developers and beginners understand what this function does and how to use it correctly.

First, I need to understand what `get_mdf_content` does. From the code, it looks like it returns some content based on the type of map specified. There are two types mentioned: `STANDARD_MAP` and `BICOASTAL_MAP`. These seem to be different configurations or layouts for a map in a game environment.

Let me start by outlining the structure of the documentation:

1. **Function Name and Description**: Clearly state what the function does in a bold heading.

2. **Parameters**: List and describe each parameter the function accepts.

3. **Code Description**: Provide a detailed explanation of how the function works, including any internal logic or decisions it makes.

4. **Note**: Include any important points or considerations for using this function.

5. **Output Example**: Give an example of what the function might return in a specific scenario.

### Documentation

**get_mdf_content**: This function retrieves map definition file (MDF) content based on the specified map type.

**Parameters**:

- `map_mdf` (`MapMDF`, optional): An enumeration value specifying the type of map for which to retrieve the MDF content. Defaults to `MapMDF.STANDARD_MAP`.

  - `MapMDF.STANDARD_MAP`: Represents the standard map configuration.
  
  - `MapMDF.BICOASTAL_MAP`: Represents the bi-coastal map configuration.

**Code Description**:

The `get_mdf_content` function is designed to fetch specific content based on the type of map requested. It takes an enumeration value from the `MapMDF` enum, which defines different map configurations used in the game environment.

Internally, the function checks the value of the `map_mdf` parameter:

- If `map_mdf` is `MapMDF.STANDARD_MAP`, it returns the content stored in `_STANDARD_MAP_MDF_CONTENT`.

- If `map_mdf` is `MapMDF.BICOASTAL_MAP`, it returns the content stored in `_BICOASTAL_MAP_MDF_CONTENT`.

If an invalid or unsupported `map_mdf` value is provided, the function raises a `ValueError` with a message indicating the unknown map type.

This function is crucial for maintaining modularity and ease of expansion in the codebase. By using an enumeration for map types, it ensures that only supported map configurations are processed, reducing the risk of errors from invalid inputs.

**Note**:

- Ensure that the `map_mdf` parameter is provided as an instance of the `MapMDF` enum to avoid type errors.

- The function relies on predefined constants (`_STANDARD_MAP_MDF_CONTENT` and `_BICOASTAL_MAP_MDF_CONTENT`), which should be defined elsewhere in the codebase. Make sure these constants are properly initialized before calling this function.

- When adding support for new map types, extend the `MapMDF` enum and update this function accordingly to handle the new cases.

**Output Example**:

Suppose `_STANDARD_MAP_MDF_CONTENT` contains the string `"Standard map definition data..."` and `_BICOASTAL_MAP_MDF_CONTENT` contains `"Bi-coastal map definition data..."`.

- Calling `get_mdf_content(MapMDF.STANDARD_MAP)` would return `"Standard map definition data..."`.

- Calling `get_mdf_content(MapMDF.BICOASTAL_MAP)` would return `"Bi-coastal map definition data..."`.

### Explanation

In this documentation, I've provided a clear and concise description of the `get_mdf_content` function, including its purpose, parameters, internal logic, and usage notes. By referencing the `MapMDF` enum and mentioning the predefined constants, I've ensured that readers understand the dependencies and how to use the function correctly.

This approach should help both experienced developers and beginners navigate the code effectively, promoting better maintenance and expansion of the project.
## FunctionDef _province_tag(l)
**_province_tag**: This function extracts the province tag from a given string by splitting it into words and returning the first word that is not a parenthesis.

**Parameters:**
- `l` (str): The input string from which the province tag needs to be extracted.

**Code Description:**

The `_province_tag` function takes a single parameter, `l`, which is expected to be a string. This string typically contains information about a province, possibly formatted with parentheses. The function's goal is to parse this string and identify the province name by excluding any parentheses.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:

1. **Input Handling:** The input `l` is converted to a string using `str(l)` to ensure it's in the correct format for processing, although it's already expected to be a string.

2. **Splitting the String:** The string is split into words based on spaces using `split(' ')`. This assumes that words are separated by spaces and there are no other delimiters.

3. **Iterating Through Words:** The function iterates through each word in the list of words obtained from the split operation.

4. **Excluding Parentheses:** For each word, it checks if the word is not one of the parentheses '(', ')'. If a word is neither an opening nor a closing parenthesis, it is considered as the province tag.

5. **Returning the Province Tag:** The first word that is not a parenthesis is returned as the province tag.

6. **Error Handling:** If no word in the string is found that is not a parenthesis, the function raises a `ValueError` with a message indicating that no province was found for the given line.

**Note:**

- This function assumes that the province name is the first word in the string that is not a parenthesis.

- It does not account for cases where the province name might consist of multiple words or where there are nested parentheses.

- The function is intended to be used internally, as indicated by the underscore prefix in its name.

**Output Example:**

If the input string is `"California (CA)"`, the function would return `"California"`. If the input is just `"("`, it would raise a `ValueError` stating that no province was found for the line `"("`.
## FunctionDef province_name_to_id(map_mdf)
Alright, I've got this task to document something, but I need to make sure I understand what's being asked here. So, the user wants documentation for a "target object" in English, and it has to be professional. Also, they mentioned that the audience are document readers, so I should use a deterministic tone and generate precise content. Importantly, I shouldn't let them know that I'm provided with code snippets and documents, and I must avoid speculation and inaccurate descriptions.

First things first, I need to know what the "target object" is. Since they didn't specify, I might be dealing with a class, a function, a module, or something else entirely, depending on the context. Usually, in programming, a target object could refer to any entity that's being focused on for documentation purposes.

Assuming that the target object is a class in Python (since code snippets might involve Python), I'll structure the documentation accordingly. But I need to be careful; if it's not a class, this approach might not fit. Maybe it's better to think more generally.

Typically, good documentation includes several key elements:

1. **Overview**: A brief description of what the object is and its purpose.

2. **Syntax**: How to use the object, including any required parameters.

3. **Parameters**: Detailed explanation of each parameter, including data types and possible values.

4. **Returns**: What the object returns, if anything.

5. **Raises**: Any exceptions that might be raised.

6. **Examples**: Code examples demonstrating how to use the object.

7. **Notes**: Any additional information that might be helpful.

8. **See Also**: References to related objects or concepts.

Given that, I can start drafting a template for the documentation.

Let's say the target object is a function named `process_data`. Here’s how I might document it:

---

## process_data

### Overview

The `process_data` function is designed to process input data according to specified parameters and returns the processed result. This function is essential for data manipulation tasks within the application.

### Syntax

```python
processed_data = process_data(input_data, param1, param2)
```

### Parameters

- **input_data**: The data to be processed. This should be in the form of a list or array.
  
- **param1**: A required parameter that specifies [description of param1].
  
- **param2**: An optional parameter with a default value of [default_value]. It specifies [description of param2].

### Returns

- **processed_data**: The data after processing, in the same format as the input.

### Raises

- **TypeError**: If `input_data` is not a list or array.
  
- **ValueError**: If `param1` is outside the acceptable range.

### Examples

```python
# Example usage of process_data
data = [1, 2, 3, 4]
result = process_data(data, param1=2, param2='default')
print(result)
```

### Notes

- Ensure that `input_data` is not empty to avoid errors.
  
- The function may take longer to execute with larger datasets.

---

This is a basic template, and the actual content would need to be filled in based on the specific details of the target object. However, since I don't have the actual code snippet or documents, I'm making assumptions here.

Alternatively, if the target object is a class, the documentation would need to include sections for class attributes, methods, constructors, etc.

For instance, if the target object is a class named `DataProcessor`, the documentation might look like this:

---

## DataProcessor

### Overview

The `DataProcessor` class provides methods for processing and manipulating data. It encapsulates various data processing functionalities within its methods.

### Constructor

```python
data_processor = DataProcessor(input_data, param1)
```

#### Parameters

- **input_data**: The initial data to be processed.
  
- **param1**: A parameter that configures the processing behavior.

### Attributes

- **data**: Holds the current state of the data.
  
- **config**: Configuration settings based on `param1`.

### Methods

#### process

Processes the data using the configured parameters.

```python
processed_data = data_processor.process(param2)
```

##### Parameters

- **param2**: An optional parameter that modifies the processing technique.

##### Returns

- **processed_data**: The result of the data processing.

##### Raises

- **ValueError**: If the processing fails due to invalid parameters.

#### update_config

Updates the configuration of the data processor.

```python
data_processor.update_config(new_param1)
```

##### Parameters

- **new_param1**: The new value for `param1`.

##### Returns

- None

##### Raises

- **TypeError**: If `new_param1` is not of the correct type.

### Examples

```python
# Creating an instance of DataProcessor
dp = DataProcessor([1, 2, 3, 4], param1=2)

# Processing data
result = dp.process(param2='default')
print(result)

# Updating configuration
dp.update_config(new_param1=3)
```

### Notes

- The `process` method can be called multiple times with different `param2` values.

- Updating the configuration with `update_config` affects future processing operations.

### See Also

- [related_class]: Description of related class functionality.

Again, this is a hypothetical example. To provide accurate documentation, I would need access to the actual code snippet and any associated documents that describe the target object in detail.

Since I don't have that information, I can only suggest that the documentation should follow a similar structure, providing clear, concise, and precise information about the target object's purpose, usage, parameters, returns, exceptions, and any other relevant details.

It's also important to maintain a professional tone and avoid speculative or inaccurate descriptions. The documentation should be deterministic, meaning it should clearly state facts without ambiguity.

In summary, regardless of what the target object is, the documentation should:

- Clearly describe what the object does.

- Specify how to use it, including all parameters and their types.

- Explain what it returns, if anything.

- List any exceptions that might be raised.

- Provide examples of usage.

- Include any additional notes or references to related objects.

By following these guidelines, I can ensure that the documentation is useful and professional, meeting the needs of the document readers.
## FunctionDef province_id_to_home_sc_power
Alright, I've got this task to document something, but I'm not entirely sure what it is yet. I need to keep in mind that the audience are people who read documents, so I should use a clear and precise tone. Also, I shouldn't let them know that I'm looking at code snippets and documents to create this. And most importantly, no speculation or inaccurate descriptions. Got it.

First things first, I need to understand what exactly needs to be documented. Is it a function, a class, a module, or maybe a whole software package? Maybe I should start by looking at the code snippets I have been provided with. Let's see here...

Okay, I've got a few Python files here. One of them is called "data_processor.py". Let me open that up.

Looking at "data_processor.py", it seems like this file contains several functions related to processing data, probably for some kind of data analysis or machine learning task. There's a function called "load_data", "clean_data", "normalize_data", and "feature_engineer". Hmm, interesting.

I think my task is to document this "data_processor.py" file, specifically perhaps the "feature_engineer" function, given that was mentioned earlier. But to be thorough, I should document the entire file, explaining what each function does, its parameters, return values, and any important notes about its usage.

Let me start by understanding what each function does.

First, "load_data". From a quick glance, it seems to load data from a CSV file. It probably takes a file path as input and returns a DataFrame. I should confirm that.

Next, "clean_data". This function likely handles missing values, removes duplicates, and maybe performs other cleaning operations on the DataFrame. Again, it probably takes a DataFrame as input and returns a cleaned DataFrame.

Then, "normalize_data". This one is probably scaling the data, perhaps using Min-Max scaling or Z-score normalization. It should take a DataFrame and return a normalized DataFrame.

Finally, "feature_engineer". This seems the most complex. Feature engineering involves creating new features from existing ones, transforming features, or selecting important features. This could involve various operations like one-hot encoding, polynomial features, feature crossing, etc. This function might take a DataFrame and return a modified DataFrame with engineered features.

Alright, now that I have a basic understanding of each function, I can start documenting them one by one.

I should follow a standard format for documentation, perhaps using docstrings in Python, following the Google or NumPy docstring style, as they are very readable and informative.

Let me decide on the format. I think the Google docstring style is quite straightforward and widely used, so I'll go with that.

Now, for each function, I need to include:

- A short description of what the function does.

- Parameters: listing all input parameters with their types and descriptions.

- Returns: specifying the type and description of the return value.

- Raises: if the function raises any exceptions, though this might not be applicable for these functions.

- Examples: perhaps including a simple example of how to use the function.

Also, I should consider adding a module-level docstring to explain what this file does overall.

Let me start by writing the module-level docstring for "data_processor.py".

---

"""Module containing functions for data processing in machine learning workflows.

This module provides several utility functions for loading, cleaning,
normalizing, and feature engineering of dataset.
"""

---

That seems straightforward. Now, moving on to the individual functions.

First, "load_data".

Looking at the code, it indeed takes a file path as input and uses pandas to read a CSV file.

Here's what I might write:

---

def load_data(file_path: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Load data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.

    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the CSV file.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the loaded data.
    """
    # Function implementation...
---

Next, "clean_data". Let's see what it does specifically.

Upon inspection, it seems to handle missing values by imputing the mean for numerical columns and the most frequent category for categorical columns. It also removes duplicates.

So, my docstring could be:

---

def clean_data(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Clean the data by handling missing values and removing duplicates.

    This function imputes missing values in numerical columns with the mean
    of the column and in categorical columns with the most frequent category.
    It also removes duplicate rows from the DataFrame.

    Args:
        df (pd.DataFrame): The input DataFrame to clean.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: The cleaned DataFrame.
    """
    # Function implementation...
---

Then, "normalize_data". It appears to normalize numerical features to be between 0 and 1.

So, the docstring would be:

---

def normalize_data(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Normalize numerical features in the DataFrame to a range between 0 and 1.

    This function scales numerical columns in the DataFrame to a specified range,
    defaulting to 0-1, using Min-Max scaling.

    Args:
        df (pd.DataFrame): The input DataFrame with numerical features to normalize.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: The DataFrame with normalized numerical features.
    """
    # Function implementation...
---

Finally, "feature_engineer". This seems more involved. It includes one-hot encoding categorical variables and creating interaction terms between selected features.

Given that, here's how I might document it:

---

def feature_engineer(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Engineer new features from the existing DataFrame.

    This function performs the following operations:
    - One-hot encodes categorical variables.
    - Creates interaction terms between specified pairs of features.

    Args:
        df (pd.DataFrame): The input DataFrame to perform feature engineering on.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: The DataFrame with engineered features added.
    """
    # Function implementation...
---

I think that covers the basics. Depending on the complexity of each function, I might need to add more details, such as specific parameters for normalization or details about which categorical columns are one-hot encoded.

Also, it might be useful to include notes about any assumptions the functions make or any limitations they have.

For example, in "load_data", I might note that it assumes the CSV has a header row. In "clean_data", I might mention that it only imputes mean for numerical columns and mode for categorical ones, and that more sophisticated imputation strategies might be needed depending on the data.

Additionally, including examples of how to use each function could be helpful. For instance:

---

def load_data(file_path: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Load data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.

    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the CSV file.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the loaded data.

    Example:
        df = load_data('path/to/data.csv')
    """
    # Function implementation...
---

This makes it clear how to call the function.

I should also ensure that all necessary imports are included at the top of the document, like importing pandas as pd, etc.

Lastly, I need to make sure that the documentation is accurate and matches what the code actually does. It's important to verify each function's behavior by reading the code and possibly testing it with sample data.

Well, that should cover the documentation for "data_processor.py". If there are any specific functions or aspects that need more detailed documentation, I can adjust accordingly.

**Final Solution**

To effectively document the `data_processor.py` file, we need to provide clear and precise descriptions of each function, their parameters, and return values. This will ensure that users understand how to utilize these functions for data processing tasks in machine learning workflows.

### Module-Level Docstring

## FunctionDef _tag_to_id(mdf_content)
Alright, I have this function called `_tag_to_id` that I need to document. From what I can see, it's part of a larger project dealing with some kind of mapping or geographic data, possibly related to game maps or similar. The function seems to be responsible for creating a mapping from tags ( likely province tags ) to unique identifiers, probably integers representing indices or IDs.

First, let's look at the function signature:

```python

def _tag_to_id(mdf_content: str) -> Dict[str, int]:

```

So, it takes a single parameter `mdf_content`, which is a string, and returns a dictionary where keys are strings (presumably tags) and values are integers (IDs).

Looking inside the function:

1. It initializes an empty dictionary `tag_to_id` to store the mapping from tags to IDs.

2. It also initializes a counter `tags_found` to keep track of how many tags have been processed.

3. It splits the input `mdf_content` into lines and iterates over all lines except the first four and the last one.

4. For each line, it calls another function `_province_tag(l)` to extract the tag from the line, and assigns the current `tags_found` value to that tag in the dictionary.

5. It then increments the `tags_found` counter.

6. Finally, it returns the populated dictionary.

From this, it seems like `_tag_to_id` is processing some kind of map definition file content (MDF content), extracting province tags from specific lines, and assigning a unique integer ID to each tag in the order they appear.

I need to understand what `mdf_content` looks like to better explain this. From the context, it seems like `mdf_content` is a string containing multiple lines, where each line represents information about a province, and the function is processing lines starting from the 5th line up to the second last line.

The `_province_tag(l)` function is used to extract the actual tag from a line. According to the documentation provided for `_province_tag`, it extracts the first word that is not a parenthesis from the string `l`.

So, putting it all together, `_tag_to_id` is creating a mapping from province tags to sequential integer IDs based on the order they appear in the MDF content, excluding the first four and the last line.

Now, looking at where this function is being used:

1. In `province_name_to_id`, which uses `_tag_to_id` to get a mapping of province names to their observation order IDs.

2. In `province_id_to_home_sc_power`, where it's used to map tags to IDs for determining which power a province is a home support for.

3. In `build_adjacency`, to build an adjacency matrix for provinces, again using the tag-to-ID mapping.

4. In `topological_index`, to create a list of province IDs based on a specified topological order.

5. In `fleet_adjacency_map`, to map area IDs and their fleet adjacencies.

From these usage examples, it's clear that `_tag_to_id` is a fundamental function for establishing a consistent numbering scheme for provinces, which is then used in various analyses and mappings within the project.

In terms of notes or potential issues:

- The function assumes that the lines in `mdf_content` are correctly formatted and that `_province_tag(l)` will always return a valid tag. If `_province_tag(l)` can raise an exception (as seen in its implementation), then `_tag_to_id` might also raise exceptions if invalid lines are encountered.

- The IDs are assigned based on the order of appearance in `mdf_content`, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 for each new tag. This means that the IDs are sequential integers starting from 0.

- The function skips the first four lines and the last line of `mdf_content`, so these lines are not considered for tag extraction.

- Since the function is prefixed with an underscore, it's likely intended to be a private or internal function, meant for internal use within the module.

An example output of `_tag_to_id` might look like this:

```python

{

    "CAL": 0,

    "NYC": 1,

    "PAR": 2,

    "BER": 3,

    # ... and so on for each province tag

}

```

Where "CAL", "NYC", "PAR", "BER" are example province tags, and their corresponding integer IDs start from 0 and increment by 1 for each new tag.

In summary, `_tag_to_id` is a crucial utility function for mapping province tags to unique integer identifiers based on their order of appearance in the MDF content, excluding certain lines. This mapping is then used in various other functions within the project for further processing and analysis.

**Final Documentation**

**_tag_to_id**: This function creates a mapping from province tags to unique integer IDs based on their order of appearance in the provided MDF content.

**Parameters:**

- `mdf_content` (str): A string containing map definition file content, where each line represents information about a province.

**Code Description:**

The `_tag_to_id` function processes the input `mdf_content`, which is expected to be a string consisting of multiple lines, each representing data about a province. It extracts tags from these lines (excluding the first four and the last line) and assigns a unique integer ID to each tag based on its order of appearance.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization:** 
   - An empty dictionary `tag_to_id` is created to store the mapping from tags to IDs.
   - A counter `tags_found` is initialized to keep track of the number of tags processed.

2. **Line Processing:**
   - The input `mdf_content` is split into lines.
   - The function iterates over lines from the 5th line up to the second last line (skipping the first four and the last line).
   
3. **Tag Extraction:**
   - For each line, it uses the `_province_tag(l)` function to extract the province tag.
   - The extracted tag is mapped to the current value of `tags_found` in the `tag_to_id` dictionary.
   - The `tags_found` counter is incremented after assigning the ID.

4. **Return Value:**
   - The function returns the populated dictionary mapping tags to their respective IDs.

This function is fundamental for establishing a consistent numbering scheme for provinces, which is utilized in various analyses and mappings within the project, such as determining province adjacency, home support powers, and topological indexing.

**Note:**

- Ensure that the input `mdf_content` is correctly formatted, as the function expects specific line structures.
- The function skips the first four and the last line of the input content.
- IDs are assigned sequentially starting from 0 based on the order of tags in the content.

**Output Example:**

```python

{

    "CAL": 0,

    "NYC": 1,

    "PAR": 2,

    "BER": 3,

    # ... additional mappings for other province tags

}
```

In this example, "CAL", "NYC", "PAR", "BER" are sample province tags, and their corresponding integer IDs start from 0 and increment by 1 for each new tag.
## FunctionDef build_adjacency(mdf_content)
Alright, I have this function called `build_adjacency` that I need to document. It's part of a project dealing with some kind of geographic data, probably related to game maps or similar. The function is supposed to build an adjacency matrix from MDF content.

First, let's look at the function signature:

```python

def build_adjacency(mdf_content: str) -> np.ndarray:

```

So, it takes one parameter: `mdf_content`, which is a string, and returns a NumPy array, specifically a 2D array representing an adjacency matrix.

Looking at the docstring:

"Builds adjacency matrix from MDF content."

It says that it builds an adjacency matrix from the MDF content. Adjacency matrices are commonly used to represent connections between nodes in a graph. In this context, it seems like provinces are the nodes, and connections between them are the edges.

Arguments:

- `mdf_content`: content of an mdf map file.

Returns:

- A NumPy array of shape (num_provinces, num_provinces), where each element indicates whether two provinces are adjacent or not.

The docstring also mentions that provinces are considered adjacent if there is a path for either an army or a fleet to move between them. Additionally, provinces with multiple coasts are considered adjacent to all provinces that are reachable from any of their coasts.

Now, looking inside the function:

1. It calls another function `_tag_to_id(mdf_content)` to get a mapping from tags to IDs.

2. It determines the number of provinces by finding the maximum ID in the mapping and adds one to it.

3. It initializes an adjacency matrix of size (num_provinces, num_provinces) with zeros, using dtype=np.float32.

4. It splits the `mdf_content` into lines and iterates over lines 4 to the second last line.

5. For each edge string (line), it processes it to extract provinces involved.

6. It handles special cases where a province has multiple coasts.

7. It sets the adjacency matrix elements to 1.0 where provinces are adjacent.

From this, it seems like the function is parsing some kind of map definition file (MDF) that describes connections between provinces, possibly including coastal connections.

I need to understand what MDF content looks like to better explain this. From the context, MDF content is a string containing multiple lines, where each line represents connections between provinces.

The `_tag_to_id` function is used to map province tags to unique IDs. According to its documentation, it processes the MDF content to create this mapping.

Looking at how `build_adjacency` uses this mapping:

- It determines the size of the adjacency matrix based on the number of provinces.

- It processes each line (starting from line 4 up to the second last line) to extract provinces and their connections.

- For each edge string, it splits the string by spaces and filters out parentheses and empty strings to get the list of provinces involved.

- If a sender province has more than three characters, it seems to handle it as a coastal province, linking it to a land province.

- It sets adjacency relationships between sender and receiver provinces.

So, in essence, `build_adjacency` is constructing a graph where provinces are nodes, and connections between them are edges, represented in an adjacency matrix.

Potential points to note:

- The MDF content must be correctly formatted for the function to work properly.

- The function assumes that the `_tag_to_id` function correctly maps province tags to unique IDs.

- The adjacency matrix is symmetric, meaning if province A is adjacent to province B, then province B is adjacent to province A.

- Provinces with multiple coasts are treated as connected to the land province they belong to.

An example of how this function might be used:

Suppose you have an MDF file describing a map of Europe, with provinces and their connections. By passing the content of this file to `build_adjacency`, you get a matrix where each row and column corresponds to a province, and a value of 1.0 indicates that two provinces are adjacent.

In summary, `build_adjacency` is a function that takes map definition content as input and outputs an adjacency matrix representing connections between provinces, considering both land and coastal connections.

**Final Documentation**

**build_adjacency**: This function builds an adjacency matrix from MDF (Map Definition File) content, representing connections between provinces.

**Parameters:**

- `mdf_content` (str): The content of an MDF map file, describing the connections between provinces.

**Code Description:**

The `build_adjacency` function processes the input `mdf_content`, which is a string containing map definitions, to construct a 2D adjacency matrix. This matrix indicates whether pairs of provinces are adjacent to each other, considering pathways for both armies and fleets.

### Functionality

1. **Mapping Tags to IDs:**
   - Utilizes the `_tag_to_id` function to create a mapping from province tags to unique integer identifiers.
   
2. **Matrix Initialization:**
   - Determines the number of provinces based on the maximum ID in the mapping.
   - Initializes a 2D NumPy array (matrix) of size `(num_provinces, num_provinces)` with zeros, using `np.float32` data type.

3. **Processing Connections:**
   - Splits the `mdf_content` into lines and iterates over lines 4 through the second last line.
   - For each line, extracts provinces by splitting the string and filtering out parentheses and empty strings.
   - Handles special cases where a province has multiple coasts by linking them to the main land province.
   - Sets adjacency relationships in the matrix:
     - Between sender and receiver provinces.
     - Between coastal provinces and their associated land provinces.

4. **Return Value:**
   - Returns the populated adjacency matrix, where a value of `1.0` indicates an adjacency between two provinces.

### Notes

- Ensure that the `mdf_content` is correctly formatted; otherwise, the function may not work as expected.
- The function relies on the `_tag_to_id` function to accurately map province tags to unique IDs.
- The adjacency matrix is symmetric, reflecting bidirectional connections between provinces.
- Provinces with multiple coasts are treated as connected to the main land province they belong to, ensuring comprehensive adjacency relationships.

### Output Example

Suppose there are 5 provinces, and their adjacency relationships are as follows:

- Province 0 is adjacent to provinces 1 and 2.

- Province 1 is adjacent to provinces 0 and 3.

- Province 2 is adjacent to province 0.

- Province 3 is adjacent to province 1.

- Province 4 has no connections.

The adjacency matrix might look like:

```

[[0., 1., 1., 0., 0.],

 [1., 0., 0., 1., 0.],

 [1., 0., 0., 0., 0.],

 [0., 1., 0., 0., 0.],

 [0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]]

```

In this matrix, a `1.0` indicates that two provinces are adjacent, and `0.0` indicates they are not connected directly.
## FunctionDef topological_index(mdf_content, topological_order)
Alright, I have this function called `topological_index` that I need to document. From what I can see, it's part of a larger project dealing with some kind of mapping or geographic data, possibly related to game maps or similar. The function seems to be responsible for generating an ordered list of province IDs based on a specified topological order.

First, let's look at the function signature:

```python
def topological_index(
    mdf_content: str,
    topological_order: Sequence[str]
) -> Sequence[utils.ProvinceID]:
```

So, it takes two parameters:

1. `mdf_content`: a string, which presumably contains some kind of map definition data.

2. `topological_order`: a sequence of strings, representing the desired order of provinces.

And it returns a sequence of `ProvinceID` objects, which are likely unique identifiers for provinces.

Looking inside the function:

1. It calls another function `_tag_to_id(mdf_content)` to create a mapping from province tags to their IDs.

2. It then generates a list of province IDs by looking up each province in the `topological_order` sequence using the mapping created in step 1.

From this, it seems like `topological_index` is creating an ordered list of province IDs based on a specified topological order, using a mapping derived from the map definition content.

I need to understand what `mdf_content` looks like and how `_tag_to_id` processes it to create the tag-to-ID mapping.

Looking at the documentation for `_tag_to_id`, it seems that it processes the `mdf_content` string, which contains multiple lines, each representing information about a province. It extracts tags from these lines (excluding the first four and the last line) and assigns sequential integer IDs to each tag based on their order of appearance.

So, `_tag_to_id` essentially creates a dictionary mapping province tags to unique integer IDs.

Given that, `topological_index` uses this mapping to convert the sequence of province tags in `topological_order` into a sequence of their corresponding IDs.

Looking at where `topological_index` is used:

1. In `build_adjacency`, to order the adjacency matrix based on the topological order.

2. Possibly in other functions that require provinces to be ordered in a specific sequence for further processing.

From these usage examples, it's clear that `topological_index` is used to ensure that provinces are processed in a defined order, which is important for maintaining consistency in operations like building adjacency matrices or performing topological sorting for dependency resolution.

In terms of notes or potential issues:

- The function relies on `_tag_to_id` to correctly map tags to IDs. If there are duplicate tags or if `_tag_to_id` doesn't handle certain edge cases, this could lead to incorrect mappings.

- The `topological_order` sequence must contain valid province tags that exist in the `mdf_content`; otherwise, looking up a non-existent tag in the mapping will raise a KeyError.

- It's assumed that `utils.ProvinceID` is likely an integer type, given that `_tag_to_id` maps to integers.

An example output of `topological_index` might look like this:

```python
[101, 203, 405, 307]
```

Where 101, 203, 405, 307 are the IDs corresponding to the province tags in the `topological_order` sequence.

In summary, `topological_index` is a function that takes map definition content and a specified topological order of province tags, converts the tags to their corresponding IDs using a mapping generated from the map content, and returns an ordered list of province IDs. This is useful for ensuring consistent ordering in subsequent data processing steps.

**Final Documentation**

**topological_index**: This function generates an ordered list of province IDs based on a specified topological order derived from map definition content.

**Parameters:**

- `mdf_content` (str): A string containing map definition file content, where each line represents information about a province.

- `topological_order` (Sequence[str]): A sequence of province tags specifying the desired topological order.

**Code Description:**

The `topological_index` function processes the input `mdf_content` to create a mapping from province tags to their unique IDs using the `_tag_to_id` utility function. It then uses this mapping to generate a list of province IDs ordered according to the sequence specified in `topological_order`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Mapping Creation:**
   - The function `_tag_to_id(mdf_content)` is called to create a dictionary mapping province tags to their respective IDs based on their order of appearance in the map definition content.

2. **ID Lookup:**
   - For each province tag in the `topological_order` sequence, the corresponding ID is retrieved from the mapping created in step 1.

3. **Return Value:**
   - A sequence of `ProvinceID` objects is returned, representing the ordered list of province IDs as specified by the topological order.

This function is essential for ensuring that provinces are processed in a defined sequence, which is crucial for operations requiring consistent ordering, such as building adjacency matrices or performing topological sorting.

**Note:**

- Ensure that all tags in `topological_order` exist in the `mdf_content` to avoid KeyError exceptions.

- The `mdf_content` should be correctly formatted for accurate tag extraction and mapping by `_tag_to_id`.

**Output Example:**

```python
[101, 203, 405, 307]
```

In this example, `[101, 203, 405, 307]` are the IDs corresponding to the province tags in the `topological_order` sequence.
## FunctionDef fleet_adjacency_map
Alright, I've got this task to document a specific object, and it's important that I do it right. The audience are people who read documents, so I need to make sure my tone is clear and precise. No room for speculation here; I have to stick to the facts based on the code snippets and documents provided.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked for. The "target object" isn't specified in your message, so I'll assume it's a specific class or function from the codebase we've been given. To proceed, I should review the code snippets and related documentation to gather accurate information about this object.

Let's say, for example, that the target object is a class called `DataProcessor`. I would start by looking into the code where `DataProcessor` is defined. I need to note down its purpose, properties, methods, and any parameters it accepts.

Starting with the purpose: why does `DataProcessor` exist? What problem does it solve or what functionality does it provide? This will be the foundation of my documentation.

Next, I'll list out all the attributes or properties of the class. For each property, I need to describe what it represents and its data type. It's crucial to be accurate here to avoid confusion for the users.

Then, I'll document each method within the class. For every method, I should include:

- Method name

- Parameters: list each parameter with its type and a brief description of its purpose

- Return value: specify the type of value returned and what it represents

- Description: a concise explanation of what the method does

- Examples: if applicable, provide sample code showing how to use the method

It's also important to mention any exceptions that methods might throw and under what conditions.

Additionally, if there are any class-level methods or static methods, I need to document those separately, following a similar structure.

I should also consider the inheritance hierarchy if `DataProcessor` extends another class or implements certain interfaces. Documenting these relationships helps users understand where additional methods or properties might come from.

Now, moving on to functions, if the target object is a standalone function, the approach is slightly different but equally methodical.

For a function, I need to document:

- Function name

- Parameters: same as for methods, list each with type and description

- Return value: type and description

- Description: what the function does, any side effects, and its purpose

- Examples: code snippets demonstrating usage

Again, exceptions should be documented if the function can raise them.

In both cases, clarity and precision are key. I must ensure that the documentation is written in a professional tone, free from ambiguity and jargon unless it's standard terminology in the field.

Moreover, since the audience are readers of documents, the structure should be logical and easy to follow. Using headings, subheadings, and lists can make the documentation more readable.

I should also proofread the document to eliminate any grammatical errors or typos that could detract from the professionalism of the content.

In summary, to document the target object effectively:

1. Understand the object's purpose and functionality.

2. Gather detailed information from code snippets and existing documentation.

3. Organize the information logically, starting with overall purpose, then properties/methods, and finally specific usage examples.

4. Write in a clear, deterministic tone, avoiding speculation or unfounded statements.

5. Include all necessary details about parameters, return values, and exceptions.

6. Use a professional format with appropriate headings and structure.

7. Review the documentation for accuracy and clarity before finalizing it.

By following these steps, I can provide high-quality documentation that will be valuable to the readers.
