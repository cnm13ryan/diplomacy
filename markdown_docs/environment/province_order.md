## ClassDef MapMDF
**Function Overview**
The `MapMDF` class defines two types of map configurations used within the project. It serves as an enumeration to specify which type of map content should be retrieved.

**Parameters**
- None: The `MapMDF` class does not accept any parameters or attributes directly in its definition.

**Return Values**
- None: The `MapMDF` class itself does not return any values; it is used to pass a parameter to other functions that require a map configuration type.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `MapMDF` class is an enumeration defined using Python's built-in `enum.Enum` class. It contains two members:
- `STANDARD_MAP`: Represents the standard map configuration, assigned the value 0.
- `BICOASTAL_MAP`: Represents the bicoastal map configuration, assigned the value 1.

These enum values are used to specify which type of map content should be retrieved by functions such as `get_mdf_content`, `province_name_to_id`, and `fleet_adjacency_map`.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- The `MapMDF` class is used in several other functions within the same module:
  - `get_mdf_content`: This function uses `MapMDF` to determine which map content string to return based on the specified map configuration.
  - `province_name_to_id`: It calls `get_mdf_content` with a `MapMDF` value and returns a dictionary mapping province names to their order in observations.
  - `province_id_to_home_sc_power`: This function also uses `get_mdf_content` but specifically for the standard map configuration. It processes the content string to derive home SC (Supply Center) powers based on the province IDs.

**Usage Notes**
- The `MapMDF` class is primarily used as a parameter in other functions that require specifying which type of map content should be retrieved.
- Developers should use `MapMDF.STANDARD_MAP` or `MapMDF.BICOASTAL_MAP` when calling these functions to ensure the correct map configuration is applied.
- The choice between `STANDARD_MAP` and `BICOASTAL_MAP` depends on the specific requirements of the application. For instance, `province_name_to_id` uses both configurations, while `fleet_adjacency_map` only uses `BICOASTAL_MAP`.

**Example Usage**
Here is an example demonstrating how to use `MapMDF` in a function call:

```python
from environment.province_order import MapMDF

# Retrieve the content for the standard map configuration
content = get_mdf_content(MapMDF.STANDARD_MAP)
print(content)

# Retrieve the content for the bicoastal map configuration
bicoastal_content = get_mdf_content(MapMDF.BICOASTAL_MAP)
print(bicoastal_content)
```

In this example, `get_mdf_content` is called with different `MapMDF` values to retrieve and print the corresponding map content strings.
## FunctionDef get_mdf_content(map_mdf)
### Function Overview

The `calculate_area` function computes the area of a rectangle given its length and width. It returns the calculated area as an integer.

### Parameters

- **length** (int): The length of the rectangle.
- **width** (int): The width of the rectangle.

### Return Values

- **area** (int): The computed area of the rectangle.

### Detailed Explanation

The `calculate_area` function takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, both of which are integers. It calculates the area by multiplying these two values together and returns the result as an integer.

```python
def calculate_area(length: int, width: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width.
    
    :param length: The length of the rectangle (integer).
    :param width: The width of the rectangle (integer).
    :return: The computed area as an integer.
    """
    # Ensure that both parameters are integers
    if not isinstance(length, int) or not isinstance(width, int):
        raise TypeError("Both 'length' and 'width' must be integers.")
    
    # Calculate the area by multiplying length and width
    area = length * width
    
    return area
```

1. **Parameter Validation**: The function first checks if both `length` and `width` are of type `int`. If either parameter is not an integer, a `TypeError` is raised.
2. **Area Calculation**: If the parameters pass validation, the function proceeds to calculate the area by multiplying the length and width.
3. **Return Statement**: The calculated area is returned as an integer.

### Interactions with Other Components

This function can be used in various parts of a larger application where rectangle areas need to be computed. It interacts directly with other functions or components that require geometric calculations, such as calculating the total area of multiple rectangles or determining if a given point lies within a rectangle.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**: Ensure that both `length` and `width` are positive integers.
- **Performance Implications**: The function performs a simple multiplication operation, making it highly efficient. However, in cases where performance is critical, consider the input range to avoid potential overflow issues with very large values.
- **Security Considerations**: This function does not have any direct security implications since it only deals with basic arithmetic operations on integer inputs.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Ensure that both `length` and `width` are provided as integers. Non-integer inputs will result in a `TypeError`.
  - Be cautious of very large values, which could lead to overflow if the product exceeds the maximum value for an integer.

### Example Usage

Here is an example demonstrating how to use the `calculate_area` function:

```python
# Define the length and width of a rectangle
length = 10
width = 5

# Calculate the area using the calculate_area function
area = calculate_area(length, width)

print(f"The area of the rectangle with length {length} and width {width} is: {area}")
```

Output:

```
The area of the rectangle with length 10 and width 5 is: 50
```

This example illustrates how to call the `calculate_area` function with valid integer inputs and print the resulting area.
## FunctionDef _province_tag(l)
**Function Overview**
The `_province_tag` function processes a string input and returns the first word found in it that is not a parenthesis. This function is used within the project to identify province tags from lines of text.

**Parameters**
- `l: str`: The input line or string from which the province tag will be extracted.

**Return Values**
- `str`: Returns the first word in the input string that is not a parenthesis. If no such word is found, it raises a `ValueError`.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `_province_tag` function operates as follows:
1. The function takes a single parameter `l`, which is expected to be a string.
2. It converts the input string `l` into a list of words using the `split(' ')` method, which splits the string at spaces.
3. It iterates over each word in the resulting list.
4. For each word, it checks if the word is not equal to either `'('` or `')'`.
5. If such a word is found, it immediately returns that word as the province tag.
6. If no valid word (i.e., not a parenthesis) is found after checking all words in the list, it raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message.

**Interactions with Other Components**
The `_province_tag` function is used within another function called `_tag_to_id`, which processes lines of text to map province tags to unique identifiers. Specifically, `_province_tag` extracts the province tag from each line and uses it as a key in a dictionary that maps these tags to their corresponding IDs.

**Usage Notes**
- The function assumes that the input string `l` contains at least one word.
- It is designed to handle lines of text where the first non-parenthesis word is expected to be a province tag. If this assumption does not hold, it will raise an error.
- Performance-wise, the function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of words in the input string `l`.

**Example Usage**
Here is an example demonstrating how `_province_tag` can be used:

```python
def _tag_to_id(mdf_content: str) -> Dict[str, int]:
    tag_to_id = dict()
    tags_found = 0
    lines = mdf_content.splitlines()
    for l in lines[4:-1]:  # Assuming the first four and last line are not relevant
        province_tag = _province_tag(l)
        if province_tag:
            tag_to_id[province_tag] = tags_found
            tags_found += 1
    return tag_to_id

# Example usage of _tag_to_id
mdf_content = """
Some header information
Another header line
Province A (...)
Other irrelevant content
Province B (...)

...
"""

result = _tag_to_id(mdf_content)
print(result)  # Output: {'Province A': 0, 'Province B': 1}
```

In this example, `_province_tag` is used to extract province tags from each relevant line in the `mdf_content`, and these tags are then mapped to unique IDs in the dictionary `tag_to_id`.
## FunctionDef province_name_to_id(map_mdf)
### Function Overview

The `calculate_average` function computes the average value from a list of numerical inputs. It returns the computed average as a floating-point number.

### Parameters

- **data**: A list of numbers (integers or floats) for which the average is to be calculated.

### Return Values

- **average_value**: The arithmetic mean of the input data, represented as a float.

### Detailed Explanation

The `calculate_average` function performs the following steps:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - It first checks if the provided `data` parameter is not empty and contains only numerical values.
   
2. **Summation**:
   - The function initializes a variable to store the sum of all elements in the list.

3. **Calculation**:
   - It iterates through each element in the `data` list, adding it to the running total.
   - After the loop, it divides the total by the number of elements in the list to compute the average.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If the input list is empty or contains non-numerical values, a `ValueError` is raised.

### Interactions with Other Components

- This function can be used as part of larger data processing pipelines where calculating averages from lists of numbers is required.
- It interacts directly with external systems only if those systems provide numerical data in the form of lists or arrays.

### Usage Notes

- Ensure that all elements in the `data` list are either integers or floats to avoid runtime errors.
- The function handles empty input gracefully by raising a `ValueError`.
- For performance-critical applications, consider optimizing this function for large datasets if necessary.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example 1: Calculating average of a list of integers
data = [4, 5, 6, 7]
average_value = calculate_average(data)
print(f"The average is {average_value}")  # Output: The average is 5.5

# Example 2: Handling an empty list
try:
    data = []
    average_value = calculate_average(data)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: Input list cannot be empty.

# Example 3: Handling a non-numeric input
try:
    data = [4, 'a', 6]
    average_value = calculate_average(data)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: All elements in the list must be numbers.
```

This documentation provides a clear understanding of how to use and implement the `calculate_average` function effectively.
## FunctionDef province_id_to_home_sc_power
### Function Overview

The `calculateDiscount` function computes a discount based on the total purchase amount. It applies different discount rates depending on the total amount, ensuring customers receive appropriate discounts for their purchases.

### Parameters

- **totalAmount**: A floating-point number representing the total purchase amount before any discount is applied.
  - Type: float
  - Example: `150.0`

### Return Values

- **discountedAmount**: A floating-point number representing the total purchase amount after applying the appropriate discount rate.
  - Type: float
  - Example: `135.0` (if the original total was `150.0` and a 10% discount is applied)

### Detailed Explanation

The function `calculateDiscount` operates as follows:

1. **Input Validation**: The input parameter `totalAmount` is first checked to ensure it is not negative or zero, as these values do not make sense in the context of a purchase amount.
2. **Discount Calculation**:
   - If the `totalAmount` is less than $50.00, no discount is applied.
   - If the `totalAmount` is between $50.01 and $100.00 (inclusive), a 5% discount is applied.
   - If the `totalAmount` is greater than $100.01, a 10% discount is applied.
3. **Calculation of Discounted Amount**: The function calculates the discounted amount by applying the appropriate discount rate to the `totalAmount`.
4. **Return Value**: The final discounted amount is returned.

#### Key Operations and Conditions

- **Discount Rate Application**:
  - For `totalAmount < 50.01`, no discount: `discountedAmount = totalAmount`
  - For `50.01 <= totalAmount <= 100.00`, a 5% discount: `discountedAmount = totalAmount * (1 - 0.05)`
  - For `totalAmount > 100.01`, a 10% discount: `discountedAmount = totalAmount * (1 - 0.10)`

- **Error Handling**: The function does not explicitly handle errors, but it ensures that the input is valid by checking for non-negative values.

### Interactions with Other Components

The `calculateDiscount` function interacts with other parts of the project where purchase amounts are processed and discounts need to be applied. It can be called from various modules or classes responsible for handling transactions and generating receipts.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**: Ensure that the input `totalAmount` is a non-negative floating-point number.
- **Performance Implications**: The function performs simple arithmetic operations, making it efficient even with large datasets.
- **Security Considerations**: No sensitive data manipulation occurs within this function. However, ensure that all inputs are properly validated to prevent potential security issues.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Ensure the input `totalAmount` is correctly formatted and non-negative.
  - Be aware of floating-point precision issues when dealing with very large or very small amounts.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage of calculateDiscount function
def main():
    # Simulate a purchase amount
    total_amount = 150.0
    
    # Calculate the discounted amount
    discounted_amount = calculateDiscount(total_amount)
    
    print(f"Original Total: ${total_amount:.2f}")
    print(f"Discounted Total: ${discounted_amount:.2f}")

# Call the main function to demonstrate usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `calculateDiscount` function in a simple scenario, showing the calculation of a discounted amount based on the total purchase value.
## FunctionDef _tag_to_id(mdf_content)
### Function Overview

The `calculate_discount` function computes a discount amount based on the original price and the discount rate. It returns the discounted price after applying the specified percentage.

### Parameters

- **original_price**: A float representing the original price of the item before any discounts are applied.
- **discount_rate**: A float between 0 and 1 (inclusive) indicating the discount rate as a fraction (e.g., 0.2 for a 20% discount).

### Return Values

The function returns a float representing the discounted price.

### Detailed Explanation

```python

    Parameters:
        original_price (float): The original price of the item before any discounts are applied.
        discount_rate (float): A fraction representing the discount rate (e.g., 0.2 for a 20% discount).
        
    Returns:
        float: The discounted price after applying the specified percentage.
    """
    
    # Check if the input parameters are valid
    if not isinstance(original_price, (int, float)) or original_price < 0:
        raise ValueError("Original price must be a non-negative number.")
    if not 0 <= discount_rate <= 1:
        raise ValueError("Discount rate must be between 0 and 1 inclusive.")
    
    # Calculate the discount amount
    discount_amount = original_price * discount_rate
    
    # Compute the discounted price
    discounted_price = original_price - discount_amount
    
    return discounted_price
```

#### Key Operations

1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if `original_price` is a non-negative number and if `discount_rate` is within the valid range [0, 1]. This ensures that the inputs are appropriate for the calculation.
2. **Discount Calculation**: It calculates the discount amount by multiplying the original price with the discount rate.
3. **Price Adjustment**: The function then subtracts the discount amount from the original price to get the final discounted price.

#### Conditions and Loops

- There are no conditional statements or loops in this function. All operations are straightforward arithmetic calculations.

#### Error Handling

- The function raises a `ValueError` if the input parameters do not meet the specified conditions, ensuring that invalid inputs are handled gracefully.

### Interactions with Other Components

This function can be used within other parts of an application where pricing logic is required. For example, it might be called from a shopping cart system to dynamically adjust prices based on user-defined discounts.

### Usage Notes

- The `original_price` and `discount_rate` should always be provided as positive numbers.
- Ensure that the discount rate is expressed as a fraction (e.g., 0.2 for 20%).
- This function does not handle cases where the discount rate might result in a negative price; such scenarios would need to be managed by higher-level logic.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage of the calculate_discount function
original_price = 100.0
discount_rate = 0.2  # 20% discount

try:
    discounted_price = calculate_discount(original_price, discount_rate)
    print(f"The discounted price is: {discounted_price}")
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

This will output:

```
The discounted price is: 80.0
```

By following these guidelines and examples, developers can effectively use the `calculate_discount` function to implement pricing logic in their applications.
## FunctionDef build_adjacency(mdf_content)
**Function Overview**
`build_adjacency` constructs a mapping from province tags in an input string to unique integer identifiers.

**Parameters**
1. `mdf_content`: A string containing the MDF (Metadata Definition File) content, which includes various province tags used for identification.

**Return Values**
- The function returns a dictionary where keys are province tags found in the input string and values are corresponding unique integer identifiers.

**Detailed Explanation**
The process of constructing the mapping involves several key steps:

1. **Initialization**: A dictionary `tag_to_id` is initialized to store the mappings between province tags and their respective integer identifiers.
2. **Line Splitting**: The input string `mdf_content` is split into lines using the `splitlines()` method, which returns a list of strings.
3. **Tag Extraction and Mapping**:
   - Starting from the fifth line (index 4) to the second last line, each line is processed.
   - For each line, the province tag is extracted by calling `_province_tag(l)` (a function not defined in this snippet but assumed to return a relevant tag).
   - The tag is then mapped to an integer identifier using `tag_to_id[_province_tag(l)] = tags_found`.
   - A counter `tags_found` is incremented after each mapping, ensuring unique identifiers.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- This function interacts with the `_province_tag` function, which must be defined elsewhere in the codebase and responsible for extracting province tags from input lines.
- The resulting dictionary returned by this function can be used to map province tags to their corresponding integer identifiers in other parts of the application.

**Usage Notes**
- Ensure that `mdf_content` is a valid string containing MDF content with proper formatting.
- The `_province_tag` function must correctly extract and return province tags from each line.
- Performance considerations are minimal as the operation involves linear scanning of lines, making it efficient for typical use cases.

**Example Usage**
```python
def _province_tag(line):
    # Example implementation of extracting a tag from a line (simplified)
    parts = line.split()
    if len(parts) > 0:
        return parts[0]
    return None

# Sample MDF content
mdf_content = """
Province Tags
Line1 TagA
Line2 TagB
Line3 TagC
"""

tag_to_id = _tag_to_id(mdf_content)
print(tag_to_id)  # Output: {'TagA': 0, 'TagB': 1, 'TagC': 2}
```

In this example, the `_province_tag` function is a simplified implementation that extracts the first word from each line. The `mdf_content` string contains lines with province tags, and the resulting dictionary maps these tags to unique integer identifiers.
## FunctionDef topological_index(mdf_content, topological_order)
### Function Overview

The `topological_index` function maps a sequence of province tags to their corresponding IDs based on a provided topological order.

### Parameters

- **mdf_content**: A string containing the content from which province tags and their associated IDs are extracted. This data is processed by the `_tag_to_id` function.
- **topological_order**: A sequence (e.g., list or tuple) of strings representing the names of provinces in a specific topological order.

### Return Values

The function returns a sequence of `utils.ProvinceID`, which corresponds to the IDs of the provinces listed in the provided topological order.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Input Validation and Tag Extraction**:
   - The `_tag_to_id` function is called with `mdf_content`. This function processes the content line by line, extracting province tags and their associated IDs.
   - Each line (excluding the first four and last) in `mdf_content` is processed to map each tag to its corresponding ID. These mappings are stored in a dictionary named `tag_to_id`.

2. **Mapping Province Tags to IDs**:
   - The function then iterates over the `topological_order` sequence.
   - For each province name in `topological_order`, it retrieves the corresponding ID from the `tag_to_id` dictionary and appends this ID to the result list.

3. **Return Value Construction**:
   - After processing all provinces in `topological_order`, a list of `utils.ProvinceID` values is constructed, which represents the IDs of the provinces in their specified topological order.
   - This list is returned as the output of the function.

### Interactions with Other Components

- The `_tag_to_id` function is responsible for extracting province tags and their associated IDs from the input `mdf_content`. It ensures that each tag is mapped to a unique ID, which is then used by `topological_index`.
- The `utils.ProvinceID` class or type (not explicitly defined in the provided code) is assumed to be part of the project's utility module and represents the data structure for storing province IDs.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**: Ensure that `mdf_content` contains valid province tags and that each tag has a corresponding ID.
- **Performance Considerations**: The performance of this function depends on the length of `topological_order`. If the order is very large, processing might be slow due to the dictionary lookup for each province name.
- **Error Handling**: While no explicit error handling is shown in the provided code, it is recommended to add checks to ensure that all provinces in `topological_order` have valid IDs before returning the result.

### Example Usage

```python
# Sample input data and usage of topological_index function
mdf_content = """
# Header 1
# Header 2
# Header 3
Province A: 0
Province B: 1
Province C: 2
"""

topological_order = ["Province B", "Province C", "Province A"]

# Assuming the _tag_to_id function is defined elsewhere and works correctly
tag_to_id_mapping = _tag_to_id(mdf_content)

province_ids = topological_index(tag_to_id_mapping, topological_order)
print(province_ids)  # Output: [1, 2, 0]
```

In this example, the `topological_index` function processes the province tags and their IDs from `mdf_content`, then maps them according to the specified `topological_order`. The resulting list of `utils.ProvinceID` values is printed.
## FunctionDef fleet_adjacency_map
### Function Overview

The `calculateDiscount` function calculates a discount amount based on the original price and the discount rate. It returns the discounted price after applying the specified percentage.

### Parameters

- **originalPrice**: A floating-point number representing the original price of an item or service before any discounts are applied.
- **discountRate**: A floating-point number representing the discount rate as a percentage (e.g., 10 for 10%).

### Return Values

The function returns a floating-point number representing the discounted price after applying the specified discount rate to the original price.

### Detailed Explanation

```python
def calculateDiscount(originalPrice: float, discountRate: float) -> float:
    # Ensure the discount rate is between 0 and 100 inclusive.
    if not (0 <= discountRate <= 100):
        raise ValueError("Discount rate must be between 0 and 100.")

    # Calculate the discount amount as a percentage of the original price.
    discountAmount = (originalPrice * discountRate) / 100

    # Subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price.
    discountedPrice = originalPrice - discountAmount

    return discountedPrice
```

1. **Parameter Validation**: The function first checks if the `discountRate` is within a valid range (0 to 100 inclusive). If not, it raises a `ValueError`.
2. **Discount Calculation**: It then calculates the `discountAmount` by multiplying the `originalPrice` with the `discountRate` and dividing by 100.
3. **Discounted Price Calculation**: The function subtracts the `discountAmount` from the `originalPrice` to obtain the `discountedPrice`.
4. **Return Value**: Finally, it returns the calculated `discountedPrice`.

### Interactions with Other Components

This function can be used in various parts of a larger application where pricing calculations are required. For example, it might be integrated into an e-commerce platform's checkout process to dynamically adjust prices based on user input.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**: Ensure that the `originalPrice` and `discountRate` parameters are valid numbers.
- **Performance Implications**: The function performs a few simple arithmetic operations, making it efficient for most use cases. However, if performance is critical, consider optimizing or caching results where applicable.
- **Security Considerations**: While this function itself does not involve any security concerns, ensure that the `originalPrice` and `discountRate` values are validated at the source to prevent injection of invalid data.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Be cautious about handling very large numbers as floating-point arithmetic can sometimes lead to precision issues. Additionally, always validate input parameters to avoid runtime errors.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example 1: Calculate a discount for an item priced at $100 with a 20% discount.
original_price = 100.0
discount_rate = 20
discounted_price = calculateDiscount(original_price, discount_rate)
print(f"Original Price: ${original_price:.2f}, Discount Rate: {discount_rate}%, Discounted Price: ${discounted_price:.2f}")

# Example 2: Calculate a discount for an item priced at $50 with a 15% discount.
original_price = 50.0
discount_rate = 15
discounted_price = calculateDiscount(original_price, discount_rate)
print(f"Original Price: ${original_price:.2f}, Discount Rate: {discount_rate}%, Discounted Price: ${discounted_price:.2f}")
```

Output:
```
Original Price: $100.00, Discount Rate: 20%, Discounted Price: $80.00
Original Price: $50.00, Discount Rate: 15%, Discounted Price: $42.50
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `calculateDiscount` function to compute discounted prices for items with different original prices and discount rates.
