## ClassDef MapMDF
**Function Overview**

The `MapMDF` class is an enumeration that defines two types of map configurations: **STANDARD_MAP** and **BICOASTAL_MAP**. This enumeration is used to specify which map configuration should be utilized when retrieving or processing map-related data.

**Parameters**

- None

**Return Values**

- None

**Detailed Explanation**

The `MapMDF` class is a subclass of Python's built-in `enum.Enum`, which allows for the creation of enumerations. Enumerations are useful for defining a set of named constants, making the code more readable and maintainable.

In this case, `MapMDF` defines two constants:

1. **STANDARD_MAP**: Represents the standard map configuration with an integer value of 0.
2. **BICOASTAL_MAP**: Represents the bicoastal map configuration with an integer value of 1.

These constants are used throughout the codebase to specify which map configuration should be used when retrieving or processing data related to provinces, areas, and fleet movements.

**Usage Notes**

- The `MapMDF` enumeration is primarily used as a parameter in functions that require specifying a map configuration. For example, the `get_mdf_content`, `province_name_to_id`, `province_id_to_home_sc_power`, and `fleet_adjacency_map` functions all accept a `map_mdf` parameter of type `MapMDF`.
  
- When using `MapMDF`, it is important to ensure that the correct map configuration is specified based on the requirements of the operation. For instance, if bicoastal-specific data is needed, `MapMDF.BICOASTAL_MAP` should be used.

- The enumeration values are integers, which can be useful for indexing or other operations where integer keys are required. However, it is generally recommended to use the named constants (`STANDARD_MAP`, `BICOASTAL_MAP`) for clarity and maintainability.

- There are no limitations or edge cases associated with using the `MapMDF` enumeration itself. However, care should be taken when using the map configurations specified by this enumeration, as different configurations may lead to different results in data processing functions.
## FunctionDef get_mdf_content(map_mdf)
**Function Overview**

The `get_mdf_content` function retrieves the content of a map configuration file based on the specified `MapMDF` enumeration value. This function is crucial for accessing different map configurations used throughout the application.

**Parameters**

- **map_mdf**: An instance of the `MapMDF` enumeration, defaulting to `MapMDF.STANDARD_MAP`. This parameter specifies which map configuration content should be returned. The possible values are:
  - `MapMDF.STANDARD_MAP`: Represents the standard map configuration.
  - `MapMDF.BICOASTAL_MAP`: Represents the bicoastal map configuration.

**Return Values**

- A string containing the content of the specified map configuration file.

**Detailed Explanation**

The `get_mdf_content` function is designed to return the content of a map configuration file based on the provided `map_mdf` parameter. The function checks the value of `map_mdf` and returns the corresponding map content:

1. If `map_mdf` is `MapMDF.STANDARD_MAP`, the function returns the content stored in `_STANDARD_MAP_MDF_CONTENT`.
2. If `map_mdf` is `MapMDF.BICOASTAL_MAP`, the function returns the content stored in `_BICOASTAL_MAP_MDF_CONTENT`.

If an unknown value is passed to `map_mdf`, the function raises a `ValueError` with a message indicating the unknown map configuration.

**Usage Notes**

- The function should be used whenever map configuration content needs to be accessed based on the specified map type.
  
- Ensure that the correct `MapMDF` enumeration value is provided to avoid retrieving incorrect map content. For example, if bicoastal-specific data is required, use `MapMDF.BICOASTAL_MAP`.

- The function does not handle any file I/O operations; it relies on pre-defined constants (`_STANDARD_MAP_MDF_CONTENT` and `_BICOASTAL_MAP_MDF_CONTENT`) to return the map content. Therefore, changes in these constants will directly affect the output of this function.

- There are no limitations or edge cases associated with using the `get_mdf_content` function itself. However, care should be taken when specifying the `map_mdf` parameter to ensure that the correct map configuration is used for the intended operation.
## FunctionDef _province_tag(l)
**Function Overview**

The `_province_tag` function is designed to extract and return the first non-parenthesis word from a given string `l`.

**Parameters**

- **l (str)**: A string input from which the function attempts to identify and return the first word that is not enclosed in parentheses.

**Return Values**

- **str**: The first word found in the input string that is not a parenthesis. If no such word exists, the function raises a `ValueError`.

**Detailed Explanation**

The `_province_tag` function operates by splitting the input string `l` into individual words using spaces as delimiters. It then iterates over these words to find and return the first one that does not match the characters '(' or ')'. This is achieved through the following steps:

1. The input string `l` is converted to a string (though it's already expected to be a string) and split into a list of words using the space character as the delimiter.
2. A loop iterates over each word in the list.
3. For each word, the function checks if it is not equal to '(' or ')'.
4. The first word that does not match these conditions is returned immediately.
5. If the loop completes without finding a suitable word (i.e., all words are either '(' or ')'), the function raises a `ValueError` with an error message indicating that no province was found for the given line.

**Usage Notes**

- **Limitations**: The function assumes that the input string contains at least one non-parenthesis word. If the string only contains parentheses, a `ValueError` will be raised.
- **Edge Cases**: 
  - If the input string is empty or consists solely of spaces, the function will raise a `ValueError`.
  - If the input string contains multiple words and all but the last are enclosed in parentheses, the last word will be returned.
- **Performance Considerations**: The function's performance is generally efficient for typical use cases. However, for very large strings or inputs with an extremely high number of words, the function may experience a slight increase in execution time due to the iteration over all words.

This function is typically used within the `_tag_to_id` method, where it processes lines of content to map province tags to unique identifiers.

## FunctionDef _tag_to_id(mdf_content)
**Function Overview**

The `_tag_to_id` function is designed to process a multi-line string containing map data and generate a dictionary mapping province tags to unique integer identifiers.

**Parameters**

- **mdf_content (str)**: A multi-line string representing the content of an MDF (Map Description File) that contains information about provinces, typically formatted with specific lines reserved for different types of data.

**Return Values**

- Returns a dictionary where each key is a province tag (a string identifier for a province) and each value is a unique integer identifier assigned to that province. The integers are sequentially assigned starting from 0.

**Detailed Explanation**

The `_tag_to_id` function processes the `mdf_content` string by splitting it into individual lines. It then iterates over these lines, skipping the first four lines (which typically contain metadata or other non-map data) and the last line (which is usually a footer). For each relevant line, it extracts province tags by splitting the line into words and filtering out any parentheses or empty strings.

The function maintains a counter (`tags`) that starts at 0. As it encounters new province tags, it assigns them the current value of `tags` and increments `tags`. This ensures that each unique province tag is assigned a unique integer identifier.

The function uses a dictionary to store these mappings between province tags and their corresponding integer identifiers. If a province tag has already been encountered, it is not re-assigned a new identifier but rather mapped to the previously assigned one.

**Usage Notes**

- **Limitations**: The function assumes that the `mdf_content` string is well-formed according to the expected format, with lines reserved for map data and specific delimiters (parentheses) used to separate province tags from other information.
  
- **Edge Cases**: If the `mdf_content` string does not contain any valid province tags or if all lines are skipped due to incorrect formatting, the function will return an empty dictionary.

- **Performance Considerations**: The function's performance is directly related to the size of the input string and the number of unique province tags. It processes each line once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of lines in the `mdf_content` string.
## FunctionDef build_adjacency(mdf_content)
**Function Overview**

The `build_adjacency` function is designed to construct a num_provinces-by-num_provinces adjacency matrix from the content of an MDF (Map Description File) that describes provinces and their connections.

**Parameters**

- **mdf_content (str)**: A multi-line string representing the content of an MDF map file. This string contains detailed information about provinces, including their tags and connections.

**Return Values**

- Returns a 2D numpy array (`np.ndarray`) representing the adjacency matrix. Each element at position `[i][j]` in the matrix is `1.0` if province `i` is adjacent to province `j`, otherwise it is `0.0`. Provinces are considered adjacent if there is a path for either an army or a fleet to move between them.

**Detailed Explanation**

The `build_adjacency` function processes the `mdf_content` string to generate an adjacency matrix that captures the connectivity of provinces in a map described by the MDF file. The process involves several key steps:

1. **Mapping Tags to IDs**: The function first calls `_tag_to_id(mdf_content)` to create a dictionary (`tag_to_id`) mapping each province tag to a unique integer identifier. This dictionary is crucial for indexing into the adjacency matrix.

2. **Determining Number of Provinces**: Using the `tag_to_id` dictionary, the function calculates the total number of provinces by finding the maximum value in the dictionary and adding one (since IDs are zero-indexed).

3. **Initializing Adjacency Matrix**: An empty adjacency matrix is initialized with dimensions equal to the number of provinces (`num_provinces`). The matrix is filled with zeros initially.

4. **Processing Map Data**: The function splits the `mdf_content` into lines and iterates over these lines, skipping the first four lines (which typically contain metadata) and the last line (which is usually a footer). For each relevant line:
   - It extracts province tags by splitting the line into words and filtering out any parentheses or empty strings.
   - If the sender province tag has more than three characters, it treats the first three characters as the land province tag and marks both the full and land province tags as adjacent.
   - It then iterates over the remaining receiver provinces in the line. If a receiver is not 'AMY' (army) or 'FLT' (fleet), it marks the sender and receiver provinces as adjacent.

5. **Returning the Adjacency Matrix**: After processing all relevant lines, the function returns the populated adjacency matrix.

**Usage Notes**

- **Limitations**: The function assumes that the `mdf_content` string is well-formed according to the expected format, with lines reserved for map data and specific delimiters (parentheses) used to separate province tags from other information. If the content does not meet these expectations, the adjacency matrix may not be correctly populated.
  
- **Edge Cases**: 
  - If the `mdf_content` string does not contain any valid province tags or if all lines are skipped due to incorrect formatting, the function will return an empty adjacency matrix (all zeros).
  - Provinces with multiple coasts (e.g., Spain in the STANDARD_MAP) are considered adjacent to all provinces that are reachable from any of its coasts.

- **Performance Considerations**: The function's performance is directly related to the size of the input string and the number of unique province tags. It processes each line once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of lines in the `mdf_content` string.
## FunctionDef topological_index(mdf_content, topological_order)
**Function Overview**

The `topological_index` function is designed to process a multi-line string containing map data and a sequence of province tags, returning a list of unique integer identifiers corresponding to the specified topological order.

**Parameters**

- **mdf_content (str)**: A multi-line string representing the content of an MDF (Map Description File) that contains information about provinces, typically formatted with specific lines reserved for different types of data.
  
- **topological_order (Sequence[str])**: An ordered sequence of province tags (strings) specifying the desired topological order.

**Return Values**

- Returns a list where each element is a unique integer identifier assigned to a province tag from the `topological_order` sequence. The identifiers are derived from the mapping generated by the `_tag_to_id` function.

**Detailed Explanation**

The `topological_index` function processes the `mdf_content` string using the `_tag_to_id` function, which generates a dictionary mapping each unique province tag to a unique integer identifier. This dictionary is then used to map the province tags specified in the `topological_order` sequence to their corresponding identifiers.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the function's logic:

1. **Mapping Generation**: The `_tag_to_id(mdf_content)` function is called to generate a dictionary (`tag_to_id`) that maps each unique province tag to an integer identifier.
   
2. **Order Mapping**: The function iterates over the `topological_order` sequence, using it as a key to retrieve the corresponding integer identifiers from the `tag_to_id` dictionary.

3. **Result Compilation**: For each province tag in the `topological_order`, the function appends the corresponding identifier to a list.

4. **Return Statement**: The function returns the compiled list of identifiers, preserving the order specified by `topological_order`.

**Usage Notes**

- **Limitations**: The function assumes that all province tags in the `topological_order` sequence are present in the `mdf_content` string and that the `_tag_to_id` function correctly generates a mapping for these tags.

- **Edge Cases**: If any tag in the `topological_order` sequence is not found in the `tag_to_id` dictionary (e.g., due to missing or incorrectly formatted data), attempting to access it will raise a `KeyError`. It is recommended to ensure that all required tags are present and correctly formatted.

- **Performance Considerations**: The function's performance is primarily determined by the time taken by the `_tag_to_id` function to process the `mdf_content` string. Since the function iterates over the `topological_order` sequence once, its complexity is O(m), where m is the number of tags in the sequence. Overall, the performance is influenced by both the size of the input string and the number of unique province tags.

- **Dependencies**: The function relies on the `_tag_to_id` function, which must be correctly implemented to generate accurate mappings between province tags and identifiers.
