## ClassDef DiplomacyState
**DiplomacyState**: The `DiplomacyState` class defines a protocol for managing the state of a Diplomacy game, ensuring that certain methods are implemented to handle game progression and status checks.

### Attributes

- **is_terminal() -> bool**: Indicates whether the game has reached its conclusion.
- **observation() -> utils.Observation**: Provides the current observation of the game state.
- **legal_actions() -> Sequence[Sequence[int]]**: Returns a list of legal actions for each player, organized by power.
- **returns() -> np.ndarray**: Supplies the returns or outcomes of the game, if applicable.
- **step(actions_per_player: Sequence[Sequence[int]]) -> None**: Advances the game state based on the actions provided for each player.

### Code Description

The `DiplomacyState` class is designed as a protocol using Python's typing extensions. This ensures that any class implementing this protocol adheres to a specific set of methods, maintaining consistency and interoperability within the Diplomacy game framework.

#### Methods

1. **is_terminal() -> bool**
   - **Description**: This method checks if the current state of the game is terminal, meaning the game has ended. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the game has concluded.
   
2. **observation() -> utils.Observation**
   - **Description**: Provides the current observation of the game state. The observation likely includes information about the board, unit positions, and other relevant data needed for decision-making.

3. **legal_actions() -> Sequence[Sequence[int]]**
   - **Description**: Returns a list of legal actions for each player, organized by power. There are seven sub-lists corresponding to the seven powers in Diplomacy: Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey. Each sub-list contains integers representing possible unit actions for that power's units.
   
4. **returns() -> np.ndarray**
   - **Description**: Provides the returns or outcomes of the game, represented as a NumPy array. If the game is still in progress, it returns an array of zeros.

5. **step(actions_per_player: Sequence[Sequence[int]]) -> None**
   - **Description**: Advances the game state by applying the actions provided for each player. The `actions_per_player` parameter is a list of lists, where each sub-list corresponds to a power and contains integers representing the actions for that power's units.

### Note

- Implementers must ensure that all methods are correctly implemented to maintain the integrity of the game state.
- The use of protocols ensures type safety and clarity in method signatures.
- The legal actions are structured specifically for the seven powers in alphabetical order, which must be adhered to by implementers.

### Output Example

An example of what the `legal_actions()` method might return:

```python
[
    [101, 102, 103],  # Austria's legal actions
    [201, 202],       # England's legal actions
    [301, 302, 303],  # France's legal actions
    [401, 402],       # Germany's legal actions
    [501, 502],       # Italy's legal actions
    [601, 602, 603],  # Russia's legal actions
    [701, 702]        # Turkey's legal actions
]
```

This structure ensures that each power's possible actions are clearly delineated and accessible by index.
### FunctionDef is_terminal(self)
**is_terminal**: The function of `is_terminal` is to determine whether the game has ended.

**Parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The `is_terminal` function is a method within the `DiplomacyState` class, designed to check if the game has reached its terminal state, meaning the game has concluded. This could be due to various conditions such as all possible moves being exhausted, a player achieving victory conditions, or any other scenario that marks the end of the game.

In the provided code snippet, the function is defined with the signature `def is_terminal(self) -> bool:`, indicating that it returns a boolean value: `True` if the game has ended, and `False` otherwise. However, the implementation details are missing as the function body contains only a pass statement, which is a placeholder in Python for functions under construction.

In a complete implementation, this function would likely involve checking various game state attributes to determine if the game has reached a terminal condition. For example, it might check if there are any legal moves left for any player, if a player has achieved a specific goal, or if a certain number of turns have been exhausted.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that it is properly implemented to reflect the actual end conditions of the game. Depending on the rules and mechanics of the game, the criteria for determining if the game is terminal can vary significantly. It's crucial that this function accurately reflects these conditions to maintain the integrity of the game state management.

Additionally, since this function is part of a larger class structure (`DiplomacyState`), it may rely on other methods or attributes within the class to make its determination. Therefore, any modifications or updates to related parts of the class should be considered when implementing or reviewing this function.

In summary, `is_terminal` serves as a critical check in game state management, indicating whether the current state represents the end of the game. Its accurate implementation is essential for proper game progression and conclusion.
***
### FunctionDef observation(self)
**observation**: The function of observation is to return the current observation.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The `observation` function is designed to provide the current state or observation from the environment, specifically within the context of a diplomacy simulation or game. In reinforcement learning and AI applications, an observation typically represents the current perceptual information available to an agent about the environment at a given time step. This information is crucial for the agent to make decisions or take actions based on the current state of the environment.

In this particular implementation, the function is defined to return an object of type `utils.Observation`. However, the actual implementation is missing, as indicated by the `pass` statement. This suggests that the function is a placeholder or an abstract method that needs to be implemented in subclasses or elsewhere in the codebase.

Given the context of being part of a `DiplomacyState` class, it's likely that the observation includes data relevant to the state of diplomatic relationships, positions of entities, resources, or any other pertinent information needed for decision-making in a diplomacy scenario.

**Note**: Since the function is currently empty (`pass`), it must be implemented properly to return meaningful observations. Developers should ensure that this function is overridden in derived classes or filled with appropriate logic to gather and return the current observation from the environment. Failure to do so will result in no operation being performed, which is not useful for any practical application.

### FunctionDef legal_actions(self)
**legal_actions**: The function `legal_actions` returns a list of lists containing legal unit actions for each power in the game, sorted alphabetically.

**Parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:

The `legal_actions` method is designed to provide a structured list of legal moves for each power in a diplomatic simulation, such as in the game of Diplomacy. The method returns a sequence of sequences (lists of lists), where each sub-list corresponds to one of the seven powers: Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey. These powers are sorted alphabetically.

Each sub-list contains every possible legal action for all units controlled by that particular power, based on the current state of the game. This allows the caller to understand what moves are permissible for each power given the current board position and rules of the game.

**Note**:

- The function is intended to be used in a context where the game state is managed, and unit positions and statuses are tracked.

- Since the function does not take any parameters, it likely relies on the state of the object it belongs to (presumably an instance of `DiplomacyState`).

- The returned list is structured with sub-lists in alphabetical order of the powers, ensuring consistency in how the data is accessed.

- This method is crucial for game logic, AI decision-making, or user interfaces that need to display available moves for each power.

### FunctionDef returns(self)
Alright, I have this function to document called "returns" from the DiplomacyState class in the diplomacy_state.py file. The function is supposed to return an array of returns from the game, but it's all zeros if the game is still in progress. There's no implementation yet, just a pass statement, which means it doesn't do anything right now.

First, I need to understand what this function is intended to do. From the description, it seems like it should calculate some kind of return or outcome from the game state. In reinforcement learning or game theory, returns often refer to the total reward accumulated over time from a certain point in the game. So, perhaps this function is meant to compute the total rewards for each player or something similar.

Given that it's part of a DiplomacyState class, which is likely related to the board game Diplomacy, I should consider how returns might be calculated in that context. Diplomacy is a strategic board game where players control armies and try to conquer territories through diplomacy and warfare. So, the returns could represent something like the number of territories controlled, influence points, or some other measure of success.

Since the function is supposed to return a numpy array, it's probably expected to return numerical values. The fact that it returns all zeros if the game is in progress suggests that the actual returns are only computed when the game has ended.

Parameters:

Looking at the function definition, it doesn't take any parameters besides self, which means it operates solely on the attributes of the DiplomacyState instance.

Code Description:

The function is defined as follows:

def returns(self) -> np.ndarray:

"""The returns of the game. All 0s if the game is in progress."""

pass

So, it's a method of the DiplomacyState class that should return a numpy array. The docstring provides a brief description, but there's no implementation yet.

To properly document this, I need to explain what this function is supposed to do, its parameters, its return value, and any important notes about its usage.

First, the function name is "returns", which might be a bit confusing because "return" is a keyword in Python, but since it's a method name, it should be fine. However, perhaps a better name could be "get_returns" or "calculate_returns" to avoid confusion, but I'll stick with the given name for now.

Parameters:

As mentioned, there are no parameters besides self, so no need to document any specific parameters.

Return Value:

The function is annotated to return a numpy array. The docstring says it's the "returns of the game", which should be clarified. Presumably, this refers to the final scores or outcomes for each player at the end of the game. If the game is still in progress, it returns an array of all zeros, indicating that no final returns are available yet.

I need to make an assumption about the shape and content of this array. For example, if there are seven players in Diplomacy, it might return an array of seven elements, each representing that player's return.

Note:

One important note is that this function should be called only when the game has ended to get meaningful returns. If called while the game is still in progress, it will always return zeros, which might not be useful for certain applications, such as learning algorithms that expect some form of intermediate feedback.

Additionally, since it's returning a numpy array, users of this function need to make sure they have numpy installed and imported in their environment.

Output Example:

Suppose there are seven players, and the game has ended with the following returns: player 1 got 30, player 2 got 20, and the rest got 10 each. The returned numpy array might look like this:

np.array([30, 20, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10])

And if the game is still in progress, it would be:

np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

But again, the actual implementation details are missing, so this is just a hypothesis based on the docstring.

In summary, the "returns" method in the DiplomacyState class is intended to provide the final returns or outcomes of the game once it has concluded, represented as a numpy array. If called while the game is still ongoing, it simply returns an array of zeros.

**Final Documentation**

**Function:** `returns`

**Description:**
This function calculates and returns the final returns or outcomes of the game once it has ended. If the game is still in progress, it returns an array of all zeros indicating no final returns are available yet.

**Parameters:**
- None

**Returns:**
- `np.ndarray`: A numpy array containing the returns for each player. The length of the array corresponds to the number of players.

**Notes:**
- This function should be called only when the game has ended to obtain meaningful returns.
- If the game is still in progress, it will return an array of all zeros.
- Ensure that `numpy` is installed and imported in your environment to use this function.

**Output Example:**
When the game has ended:
```python
np.array([30, 20, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10])
```
When the game is still in progress:
```python
np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
```

**Additional Information:**
- The exact calculation of returns is not specified and would depend on the game's rules and objectives.
- The number of elements in the returned array corresponds to the number of players in the game.
***
### FunctionDef step(self, actions_per_player)
**step**: The function of step is to advance the environment forward by one full phase of Diplomacy based on the actions provided by each player.

**Parameters**:
- `actions_per_player`: A list of lists of unit-actions. There are 7 sub-lists, one per power, sorted alphabetically (Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey). Each sublist contains all of the corresponding player's unit-actions for that phase.

**Code Description**:
The `step` function is designed to progress the Diplomacy environment by one full phase based on the actions provided by each player. This function takes a single argument, `actions_per_player`, which is a sequence of sequences (lists of lists) where each sub-list corresponds to the actions of a specific power in the game, ordered alphabetically by the power's name.

The seven powers in Diplomacy are Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey. Each power has its own list of unit-actions within the `actions_per_player` sequence. These unit-actions dictate what each of the power's units will do during the current phase of the game.

It's important to note that the sub-lists within `actions_per_player` must be in alphabetical order corresponding to the powers' names, starting with Austria and ending with Turkey. This ordering ensures that the environment can correctly map the provided actions to the respective powers without ambiguity.

The function is intended to process these actions and update the state of the game accordingly, simulating the passage of one full phase in the Diplomacy game. However, the implementation details of how the actions are processed and how the game state is updated are not provided in this snippet, as the function body contains only a `pass` statement.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the `actions_per_player` parameter is correctly structured with exactly seven sub-lists, each corresponding to one of the seven powers in the established alphabetical order.
- Validate that the actions provided for each power are valid according to the rules of Diplomacy to maintain the integrity of the game state.
- Since the function is currently empty (`pass`), implement the necessary logic to process the actions and update the game state appropriately.
