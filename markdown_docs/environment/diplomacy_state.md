## ClassDef DiplomacyState
**DiplomacyState**: The function of DiplomacyState is to define the state interface for the game of Diplomacy.
**Attributes**: 
- None explicitly defined; the attributes are provided by methods and their return types.

**Code Description**: 
The `DiplomacyState` class serves as a protocol (interface) that defines how states in the game of Diplomacy should behave. It outlines essential operations such as checking if the game has ended, retrieving current observations, determining legal actions for each player, calculating returns, and advancing the game state.

1. **is_terminal(self) -> bool**: This method checks whether the game is currently in a terminal state, meaning it has ended. The return type `bool` indicates that this method will always return either `True` or `False`.

2. **observation(self) -> utils.Observation**: This method returns the current observation of the game state. Observations are typically used by agents to understand their environment and make decisions. The exact structure of `utils.Observation` is not defined here but can be inferred from its return type.

3. **legal_actions(self) -> Sequence[Sequence[int]]**: This method returns a list of lists, where each sub-list represents the legal actions that units controlled by a specific player can take in their respective phase. The sequence is ordered alphabetically by power (Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey), and each sublist contains all possible unit actions for the corresponding player.

4. **returns(self) -> np.ndarray**: This method returns an array of game returns. In a non-terminal state, this will be an array of zeros because the game is still in progress. If the game has ended, the returns might contain values indicating the outcome of the game for each player.

5. **step(self, actions_per_player: Sequence[Sequence[int]]) -> None**: This method advances the environment one full phase of Diplomacy based on a list of actions per player. The `actions_per_player` parameter is a sequence of sequences, where each inner sequence represents the unit actions taken by a specific player during their turn. The method does not return anything (`None`), as it updates the game state in place.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that all methods are implemented consistently with the protocol defined.
- The `actions_per_player` parameter must be structured correctly to match the expected format for legal actions.
- The use of NumPy arrays in the `returns` method suggests a dependency on NumPy, which should be imported and used accordingly.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Example output for is_terminal()
is_terminal() -> False  # Game is still ongoing

# Example output for observation()
observation() -> [Austria: [unit1, unit2], England: [], ...]  # Detailed observation data

# Example output for legal_actions()
legal_actions() -> [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [], [], [], [], []]  # Legal actions for each player

# Example output for returns()
returns() -> np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])  # Game is still in progress
```
### FunctionDef is_terminal(self)
**is_terminal**: The function of `is_terminal` is to determine whether the game has ended.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `is_terminal` method checks if the current state of the game represents an ending condition, such as a win, loss, or draw. It returns a boolean value (`True` if the game is over, and `False` otherwise). The implementation of this check is left as a placeholder (indicated by `pass`) in the provided code snippet, meaning that developers need to implement the specific logic for determining when the game ends based on the current state.

Given that this method does not take any parameters, it relies solely on the internal state of the object. Developers should ensure that all relevant information about the game's state is stored within `DiplomacyState` or accessed through its attributes before making a determination. This could include factors like the number of turns played, the current player’s position, resource status, or any other conditions that might indicate the end of the game.

**Note**: Ensure that the implementation of `is_terminal` accurately reflects the rules and objectives of the game being modeled by `DiplomacyState`. Any changes to the game state should trigger a re-evaluation of whether the game has ended.
***
### FunctionDef observation(self)
**observation**: The function of observation is to return the current state of the game or environment as an observation.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `observation` method is defined within the `DiplomacyState` class and returns a value of type `utils.Observation`. It serves to provide the current state of the game or environment in a structured format that can be used for decision-making processes, typically by agents or AI systems. The return type indicates that this function encapsulates the observation logic specific to the DiplomacyState context.

The implementation uses the `pass` statement, which means that the actual logic for generating the observation is not provided within this method. This suggests that the `observation` method acts as a placeholder or interface for more detailed implementations in derived classes or during runtime based on specific conditions and requirements of the game state.

**Note**: Users should ensure that they have imported the correct type from the `utils` module, as the return type is dependent on this import. Additionally, developers must implement the actual logic to generate the observation within a concrete subclass or override method if necessary.
***
### FunctionDef legal_actions(self)
**legal_actions**: The function of legal_actions is to return a list of all possible legal unit actions for each power.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `legal_actions` method returns a sequence of sequences, where each sub-sequence corresponds to the legal actions available for one of the seven powers in the game. The order of these sub-sequences is fixed and follows alphabetical order: Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey.

Within each sub-sequence, every element represents a possible action that can be performed by any unit controlled by the corresponding power. These actions are determined based on the current state of the game, such as the position of units, available resources, and other relevant factors.

The structure of this function is crucial for determining valid moves in the game, ensuring that players can only make legal actions according to the rules. By providing a clear and organized representation of these actions, it supports both human players and AI systems in making informed decisions during gameplay.
**Note**: 
- Ensure that the returned sequences are up-to-date with the current state of the game, as legality of actions may change over time due to events or changes in unit positions.
- The method should be called whenever the game state changes to reflect any new legal actions.
***
### FunctionDef returns(self)
**returns**: The function of returns is to retrieve the game's return values as an array.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `returns` method within the `DiplomacyState` class is designed to provide information about the outcome of a game. If the game is still in progress, it returns an array filled with zeros. Once the game has ended, this method will return the actual returns or outcomes associated with each player or state, represented as an `np.ndarray`.

The implementation of this function uses NumPy (`np`) to ensure that the returned data structure is a well-defined and efficient multi-dimensional array. This approach facilitates easy manipulation and analysis of the game's results.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the NumPy library is properly imported at the beginning of the file.
- The method assumes that the state of the game has been correctly tracked throughout its execution, allowing for accurate determination whether to return zeros or actual returns.
- This function should be called after the game logic has determined the final outcome.

**Output Example**: 
If the game is in progress, `returns` will output an array like `[0., 0., 0.]`.
If the game has ended and player outcomes are as follows: Player 1 gains 5 points, Player 2 loses 3 points, and Player 3 gains 2 points, then `returns` might output an array such as `[5., -3., 2.]`.
***
### FunctionDef step(self, actions_per_player)
**step**: The function of step is to advance the environment through a full phase of Diplomacy.
**parameters**:
· actions_per_player: A list of lists of unit-actions. There are 7 sub-lists, one per power (Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey), sorted alphabetically, each sublist contains all corresponding player's unit-actions for that phase.

**Code Description**: The `step` function is responsible for advancing the state of the Diplomacy game environment through a complete phase. This involves processing and applying actions submitted by players (each representing one of the 7 major powers in the game) during their respective turns. Here’s a detailed analysis:

- **Parameter Breakdown**:
  - `actions_per_player`: This is a critical input to the function, structured as a list where each element corresponds to an action taken by a specific player. Each sublist contains actions for one of the seven players in alphabetical order.
  
- **Function Execution**:
  The function does not return any value (as indicated by the `-> None` type annotation), meaning its purpose is purely procedural and involves updating the state of the game environment based on the provided actions.

- **Game Flow**:
  - The function expects that each player has submitted their actions for all units they control.
  - These actions are processed in a predefined order, ensuring fairness and consistency across different runs of the game.
  - The function likely updates internal state variables such as unit positions, resource states, and other relevant game mechanics to reflect these actions.

- **Phase Progression**:
  Given that this method steps through a "full phase," it implies that multiple sub-phases or rounds are handled within one call. This could involve turn-based decision-making, movement of units, combat resolutions, and more, depending on the specific rules of the Diplomacy game being simulated.

- **Error Handling**:
  While not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, this function should include robust error handling to manage invalid or unexpected input data. For instance, ensuring that each sublist has the correct number of actions corresponding to the player's units and validating action types before processing them.

- **State Transition**:
  The `step` method transitions the game from one phase state to another, preparing it for the next set of player inputs or automating subsequent phases if AI opponents are involved. It essentially manages the turn-based progression of the game.

**Note**: Ensure that all actions submitted in `actions_per_player` are valid according to the rules of Diplomacy and that the function handles edge cases gracefully to maintain game integrity.
