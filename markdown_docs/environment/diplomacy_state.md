## ClassDef DiplomacyState
**DiplomacyState**: The function of DiplomacyState is to define a protocol for managing the state of a Diplomacy game environment.
**attributes**: The attributes of this Class are defined by its methods, which include:
· `is_terminal`: a method to determine whether the game has ended
· `observation`: a method to retrieve the current observation of the game state
· `legal_actions`: a method to obtain a list of legal unit actions for each power in the game
· `returns`: a method to get the returns of the game, which are all 0s if the game is still in progress
· `step`: a method to advance the game environment by one full phase based on the provided actions

**Code Description**: The DiplomacyState Class is designed to provide a standardized interface for interacting with a Diplomacy game environment. It defines several key methods that allow users to query and manipulate the game state. The `is_terminal` method returns a boolean indicating whether the game has ended, while the `observation` method returns an object representing the current state of the game. The `legal_actions` method generates a list of lists, where each sublist contains the legal unit actions for a particular power in the game, ordered alphabetically by power name. The `returns` method provides an array of returns for the game, which will be all 0s if the game is still ongoing. Finally, the `step` method takes a list of lists of unit actions as input and advances the game environment by one full phase.

**Note**: When using the DiplomacyState Class, it is essential to ensure that the input actions provided to the `step` method are valid and follow the expected format, which consists of a list of lists where each sublist corresponds to the actions for a particular power. Additionally, users should be aware that the `returns` method will only provide meaningful values once the game has ended.

**Output Example**: The output of the `legal_actions` method might look like this: `[ [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]], ... ]`, where each inner list represents the legal unit actions for a particular power in the game. The actual output will depend on the specific game state and the powers involved.
### FunctionDef is_terminal(self)
**is_terminal**: The function of is_terminal is to determine whether the game has ended.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· self: a reference to the current instance of the class
**Code Description**: The description of this Function. 
This function checks if the game has reached its terminal state, indicating that the game has ended. It returns a boolean value, with True indicating the game is over and False indicating it is not. The function does not take any parameters other than the implicit self reference to the instance of the class it belongs to.
**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code. 
The return type of this function is bool, so it can be used directly in conditional statements to control the flow of a program based on whether the game has ended or not. The exact conditions that lead to the game being considered over are not specified within this function and would depend on the implementation details provided elsewhere in the class.

### FunctionDef observation(self)
**observation**: The function of observation is to return the current observation.
**parameters**: There are no parameters for this Function.
· None: This function does not take any arguments.
**Code Description**: This function is defined as an instance method, denoted by the `self` parameter, which refers to the instance of the class it belongs to. The function returns a value of type `utils.Observation`, indicating that it provides some form of observation data. The actual implementation of this function is currently empty, as indicated by the `pass` statement, suggesting that the specific details of how the observation is generated or retrieved are not yet defined.
**Note**: When using this function, be aware that its current implementation does not provide any actual observation data, and it will need to be implemented according to the requirements of the project. Additionally, understanding the structure and content of `utils.Observation` is crucial for effectively utilizing the returned value from this function.
***
### FunctionDef legal_actions(self)
**legal_actions**: The function of legal_actions is to return a list of lists of legal unit actions for each power in a given position.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function are none, as it is an instance method that relies on the state of the object it belongs to.
· self: a reference to the current instance of the class
**Code Description**: This function returns a sequence of sequences of integers, where each inner sequence represents the legal unit actions for a specific power. There are 7 sub-lists in total, one for each power, sorted alphabetically by country name (Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey). Each sub-list contains every possible unit action for all units of the corresponding power in the given position.
**Note**: The function does not take any explicit parameters and its behavior is determined by the state of the object it belongs to. The returned list of lists provides a comprehensive overview of the legal actions available to each power, making it a useful tool for decision-making and strategy development in a diplomatic context.
***
### FunctionDef returns(self)
**returns**: The function of returns is to retrieve the returns of the game as a numpy array.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· self: a reference to the current instance of the class
**Code Description**: This function appears to be part of a class, likely used in a game environment, and is designed to return the returns of the game. The returns are represented as a numpy array. If the game is currently in progress, the function will return an array of all zeros.
**Note**: It's important to note that this function does not take any parameters other than the implicit self reference, which suggests it relies on the state of the instance it's called on. The actual calculation or retrieval of the returns is not implemented in this code snippet, as indicated by the pass statement.
**Output Example**: A possible output of this function could be a numpy array, for example: np.array([0, 0, 0]) if the game is in progress, or a different array containing the actual returns if the game has ended.
***
### FunctionDef step(self, actions_per_player)
**step**: The function of step is to advance the environment forward by one full phase of Diplomacy.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· actions_per_player: A list of lists of unit-actions, where each sublist represents the actions for a specific power, with 7 sublists in total, corresponding to Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey, in alphabetical order.
**Code Description**: This function takes a sequence of sequences of integers as input, representing the actions for each player in the current phase. The input is expected to have 7 sublists, one for each power, with each sublist containing all the unit-actions for that power in the current phase. The function then steps the environment forward by one full phase, presumably updating the game state based on the provided actions.
**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the input actions_per_player has the correct structure and content, with 7 sublists, each corresponding to a specific power, to avoid potential errors or unexpected behavior when calling this function.
