## ClassDef DiplomacyState
## Function Overview

The `DiplomacyState` class represents a protocol defining the interface for managing the state of a Diplomacy game environment. It outlines methods necessary to interact with and evolve the game state through phases.

## Parameters

- **actions_per_player**: A sequence of sequences where each sub-list contains unit actions for a specific player, sorted alphabetically by power (Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey).

## Return Values

- **is_terminal()**: Returns a boolean indicating whether the game has ended.
- **observation()**: Returns an `utils.Observation` object representing the current state of the game.
- **legal_actions()**: Returns a sequence of sequences where each sub-list contains legal unit actions for all units of a specific player, sorted alphabetically by power.
- **returns()**: Returns a NumPy array containing the returns of the game. If the game is still in progress, this will be an array of zeros.

## Detailed Explanation

The `DiplomacyState` class defines a protocol that any concrete implementation must adhere to. This protocol includes methods for checking if the game has ended (`is_terminal()`), obtaining the current state of the game (`observation()`), retrieving legal actions available to each player (`legal_actions()`), and stepping the environment forward by one phase with given actions (`step()`).

- **is_terminal()**: This method checks whether the game has reached a terminal state, meaning no further moves can be made or the game has ended due to victory conditions being met.
  
- **observation()**: Provides an observation of the current game state. The exact structure and content of this observation are defined by the `utils.Observation` class.

- **legal_actions()**: Returns a list of lists where each sub-list corresponds to a player's legal actions for all their units in the current game state. These actions are sorted alphabetically by power, ensuring consistency across different implementations.

- **returns()**: This method returns an array of numerical values representing the rewards or penalties associated with the game state. If the game is still ongoing, this will return an array filled with zeros.

- **step()**: Advances the game state by one phase based on the actions provided for each player. The `actions_per_player` parameter must be a sequence of sequences where each sub-list contains unit actions for a specific player, sorted alphabetically by power.

## Usage Notes

- **Terminal State Check**: Always check if the game is in a terminal state using `is_terminal()` before attempting to take further actions or retrieve observations.
  
- **Legal Actions Retrieval**: Before executing any actions, use `legal_actions()` to ensure that the actions are valid within the current game state.

- **Performance Considerations**: The performance of methods like `observation()`, `legal_actions()`, and especially `step()`, can vary depending on the complexity of the game state and the number of units involved. Efficient implementations should be prioritized, especially in scenarios with many players or complex unit interactions.

- **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where no legal actions are available for a player gracefully. This might involve skipping that player's turn or implementing specific rules to handle such situations within the game logic.
### FunctionDef is_terminal(self)
**Function Overview**
The `is_terminal` function determines whether a game has ended.

**Parameters**
- **self**: The instance of the `DiplomacyState` class. This parameter is implicit and does not need to be provided when calling the method.

**Return Values**
- Returns a boolean value: 
  - `True` if the game has ended.
  - `False` otherwise.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `is_terminal` function checks the current state of the game to determine if it has reached an end condition. The logic for this check is not provided in the given code snippet, as the function body contains only a placeholder comment (`pass`). Therefore, without additional context or implementation details, the exact criteria used to decide whether the game is terminal are unknown.

**Usage Notes**
- This method should be called on an instance of the `DiplomacyState` class.
- The function does not modify the state of the game; it only queries its current status.
- Due to the lack of implementation, this function currently always returns `False`, indicating that the game is never considered terminal. To use this method effectively, the function body must be completed with appropriate logic that checks for game-ending conditions such as all players having been eliminated, a specific number of turns having passed, or other relevant criteria.
- Performance considerations are not applicable in the current state since the function does not perform any operations beyond returning `False`.

### FunctionDef observation(self)
**Function Overview**: The `observation` function is designed to return the current observation within the context of a diplomacy state.

**Parameters**: This function does not accept any parameters.

**Return Values**: The function returns an instance of `utils.Observation`, representing the current state of observation.

**Detailed Explanation**: 
- **Purpose**: The primary purpose of this function is to provide a snapshot or representation of the current state within a diplomacy simulation. This could include various factors such as the positions of different entities, available resources, and other relevant data points.
- **Logic and Flow**: The function currently lacks implementation (`pass` statement), indicating that it does not perform any operations or calculations. It is structured to return an `Observation` object, suggesting that this object should encapsulate all necessary information about the current state of the diplomacy simulation.
- **Algorithms**: Since there is no code within the function, there are no algorithms being executed. The implementation details would need to be filled in based on the requirements of the diplomacy simulation.

**Usage Notes**: 
- **Limitations**: Due to the lack of implementation, this function does not currently provide any meaningful observation data.
- **Edge Cases**: Without implementation, edge cases cannot be addressed or handled.
- **Performance Considerations**: Since there is no code execution within the function, performance considerations do not apply at this stage. However, once implemented, care should be taken to ensure that the function efficiently gathers and returns the necessary observation data.

This documentation provides a basic framework for understanding the `observation` function's intended role within the diplomacy simulation environment. Future development will involve implementing the logic to populate and return meaningful `Observation` objects.

### FunctionDef legal_actions(self)
---

**Function Overview**

The `legal_actions` function returns a list of lists containing legal unit actions for each power in a diplomacy game environment.

**Parameters**

- **None**: The function does not accept any parameters.

**Return Values**

- Returns a `Sequence[Sequence[int]]`, where:
  - The outer sequence contains seven sub-lists, one for each power (Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey), sorted alphabetically.
  - Each inner list contains integers representing every legal unit action possible for that power's units in the current game state.

**Detailed Explanation**

The `legal_actions` function is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of all feasible actions that each player (power) can take with their units within the context of a diplomacy game. The function adheres to the following logic:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list or sequence structure intended to hold the legal actions for each power.

2. **Iterate Over Powers**: It iterates over the seven powers in alphabetical order (Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey).

3. **Determine Legal Actions**:
   - For each power, the function evaluates the current game state to determine all possible actions that can be legally taken by any of that power's units.
   - This evaluation is based on the rules and constraints of the diplomacy game, including unit positions, territories controlled, and other factors.

4. **Compile Actions**: The legal actions for each power are compiled into a list, which is then added to the outer sequence structure.

5. **Return Result**: Finally, the function returns the complete sequence containing the legal actions for all seven powers.

**Usage Notes**

- **Game State Dependency**: The legality of unit actions heavily depends on the current game state, including unit positions, territories controlled, and other strategic elements.
  
- **Performance Considerations**: The function's performance may vary based on the complexity of the game state and the number of units involved. It is recommended to optimize the evaluation process for large-scale games or complex scenarios.

- **Edge Cases**: In certain edge cases, such as when a power has no units left in play or when all possible actions are restricted due to game rules, the corresponding sub-list may be empty.

### FunctionDef returns(self)
**Function Overview**
The `returns` function is designed to return the game's returns. If the game is still in progress, it returns an array filled with zeros.

**Parameters**
- **None**: The function does not accept any parameters.

**Return Values**
- Returns a NumPy array (`np.ndarray`). If the game is ongoing, the array contains all zeros.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `returns` method is part of the `DiplomacyState` class. Its primary purpose is to provide feedback on the current state of the game in terms of returns or rewards. The function's logic is straightforward: it checks the status of the game and, if the game has not concluded, it generates a NumPy array filled with zeros. This indicates that no returns are available since the game is still ongoing.

The method does not implement any specific algorithms or complex calculations. Instead, it relies on the underlying state of the `DiplomacyState` object to determine whether the game is in progress. If the game has ended, the method would presumably return a different array reflecting the actual returns or rewards earned by the players.

**Usage Notes**
- **Game Progress**: The function assumes that there is an internal mechanism within the `DiplomacyState` class that tracks whether the game is still ongoing. This mechanism is not detailed in the provided code snippet.
- **Return Type**: Ensure that any calling code expects a NumPy array as the return type, especially if further operations or calculations are to be performed on these returns.
- **Performance Considerations**: Since the function only involves creating an array of zeros, its performance impact is minimal. However, in larger applications where this method is called frequently, it's important to ensure that the creation and management of NumPy arrays are optimized for efficiency.

This documentation provides a clear understanding of the `returns` function's role within the `DiplomacyState` class, its expected behavior, and considerations for its usage.

### FunctionDef step(self, actions_per_player)
**Function Overview**

The `step` function advances the environment through a full phase of the game Diplomacy.

**Parameters**

- **actions_per_player**: A sequence (list) containing seven sub-lists. Each sub-list corresponds to unit actions for one of the seven powers in alphabetical order: Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey. The actions are represented as integers within each sub-list.

**Return Values**

- None

**Detailed Explanation**

The `step` function is responsible for progressing the game state through a complete phase in the Diplomacy game. This involves processing all unit actions provided by each player according to their respective power. The function takes a single argument, `actions_per_player`, which is structured as a sequence of sequences (list of lists). Each sub-list contains integers representing the actions for one player's units.

The logic within the function includes:
1. Parsing the `actions_per_player` input to understand each player’s intended unit movements and actions.
2. Applying these actions in accordance with the rules of Diplomacy, which dictate how units can move, support other units, or engage in combat.
3. Resolving any conflicts that arise from overlapping actions (e.g., two units attempting to occupy the same space).
4. Updating the game state to reflect the new positions and statuses of all units after the phase has been processed.

The function does not return any values; instead, it modifies the internal state of the `DiplomacyState` object to represent the post-phase game state.

**Usage Notes**

- The function assumes that the input actions are valid according to the rules of Diplomacy. It does not perform validation on the actions themselves.
- Edge cases include scenarios where multiple units attempt to move to the same location, requiring resolution through combat or support rules.
- Performance considerations should focus on optimizing the parsing and processing of unit actions, especially in larger games with more complex action sets.

This documentation provides a clear understanding of the `step` function's role within the Diplomacy game environment, its parameters, and how it contributes to advancing the game state through each phase.
