## ClassDef DiplomacyState
**Function Overview**
The `DiplomacyState` class defines a protocol for managing the state of a Diplomacy game. It provides methods for checking if the game has ended, retrieving observations, legal actions, and stepping through the game phases.

**Parameters**

- **is_terminal()**: This method does not take any parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the game is in a terminal state (i.e., the game has ended).

- **observation()**: This method does not take any parameters and returns an `Observation` object, which represents the current state of the game from the perspective of the player.

- **legal_actions()**: This method does not take any parameters and returns a list of lists. Each sublist corresponds to one of the seven powers in the game (Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey), sorted alphabetically. The sublists contain all possible legal unit actions for each power's units.

- **returns()**: This method does not take any parameters and returns a NumPy array (`np.ndarray`). If the game is still in progress, this array will be filled with zeros; otherwise, it contains the returns (scores) of the players at the end of the game.

- **step(actions_per_player)**: This method takes one parameter:
  - `actions_per_player`: A list of lists where each sublist corresponds to a player and contains their unit actions for that phase. The sublists are ordered alphabetically by power, with seven sublists in total (one per power).

**Return Values**

- **is_terminal()**: Returns a boolean value (`True` if the game has ended; `False` otherwise).
- **observation()**: Returns an `Observation` object representing the current state of the game.
- **legal_actions()**: Returns a list of lists, each sublist containing legal actions for units under the control of a specific power.
- **returns()**: Returns a NumPy array with the returns (scores) of the players if the game has ended; otherwise, it returns an array filled with zeros.

**Detailed Explanation**

The `DiplomacyState` class is designed to encapsulate the state and behavior of a Diplomacy game. It provides several methods that allow interaction with the game's current state:

1. **is_terminal()**: This method checks if the game has reached its terminal state, meaning no further actions can be taken or the game has concluded due to some predefined condition (e.g., all players have agreed on a peace treaty).

2. **observation()**: This method returns an `Observation` object that provides a snapshot of the current state from the player's perspective. The observation could include details such as unit positions, territories controlled, and available resources.

3. **legal_actions()**: This method generates all possible legal actions for each power in the game. Each sublist corresponds to one of the seven powers (Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey), sorted alphabetically. The sublists contain every unit action that is valid given the current state of the game.

4. **returns()**: This method returns a NumPy array with the final scores or returns for each player if the game has ended; otherwise, it returns an array filled with zeros indicating that the game is still in progress.

5. **step(actions_per_player)**: This method advances the game by one phase based on the actions provided by each player. The `actions_per_player` parameter should be a list of lists where each sublist corresponds to a player and contains their unit actions for that phase. The method updates the state of the game according to these actions, ensuring that only legal actions are taken.

**Interactions with Other Components**

The `DiplomacyState` class interacts with other components in the project by providing methods that allow external systems or agents to interact with the game's state and progress. For example, an agent might use the `observation()` method to get a current view of the game, use the `legal_actions()` method to determine valid moves, and then use the `step(actions_per_player)` method to execute those moves.

**Usage Notes**

- **Preconditions**: Ensure that all actions passed to the `step()` method are legal. The `legal_actions()` method can be used to validate these actions.
- **Performance Considerations**: The `legal_actions()` method may become computationally expensive as the number of units and possible actions increases, especially in complex game states.
- **Handling Terminal States**: When calling `is_terminal()`, ensure that you handle both terminal and non-terminal cases appropriately. For example, if the game has ended, you might want to retrieve the final scores using the `returns()` method.

**Example Usage**

```python
# Example of using the DiplomacyState class

from diplomacy_game import Observation, DiplomacyState  # Hypothetical module names

state = DiplomacyState()

while not state.is_terminal():
    observation = state.observation()
    legal_actions = state.legal_actions()
    
    # Agent makes decisions based on the current observation and legal actions
    player_actions = [make_decision(observation, action) for action in legal_actions]
    
    state.step(player_actions)
```

This example demonstrates how an agent might use the `DiplomacyState` class to interact with a Diplomacy game. The agent retrieves observations, determines legal actions, and then takes steps based on its decisions. 

**Conclusion**

The `DiplomacyState` class provides a structured way to manage the state of a Diplomacy game, allowing for interaction through various methods that reflect the dynamics of the game. By using these methods, agents or external systems can effectively engage with the game and make informed decisions based on the current state.
### FunctionDef is_terminal(self)
**Function Overview**
The `is_terminal` method determines whether the current state of a diplomatic game has reached its terminal condition.

**Parameters**
- None. The method does not accept any parameters or attributes from external sources.

**Return Values**
- A boolean value (`True` or `False`). Returns `True` if the game is in a terminal state, indicating that no further actions can be taken; otherwise, returns `False`.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `is_terminal` method checks whether the current state of the game has reached its end. This typically involves evaluating various conditions within the `DiplomacyState` class to determine if any predefined criteria for a terminal state have been met.

1. **Initialization**: The method is called as part of the `DiplomacyState` object's methods or properties.
2. **Condition Evaluation**:
   - It evaluates internal attributes and conditions that define when a game state is considered terminal.
   - These conditions might include checks for specific player actions, global game states, or predefined end-game scenarios.
3. **Boolean Return**: Based on the evaluation, it returns `True` if all terminal conditions are met, indicating the game has ended; otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- The method interacts with other parts of the `DiplomacyState` class to access and evaluate its internal state.
- It may also interact with external components such as game logic or user input handlers to determine if certain terminal conditions have been triggered.

**Usage Notes**
- **Preconditions**: Ensure that the `is_terminal` method is called within a valid context where the `DiplomacyState` object's attributes are properly initialized.
- **Performance Considerations**: The method should be optimized for efficiency, as it may be called frequently during game updates. Avoid complex or computationally expensive operations inside this method.
- **Security Considerations**: Ensure that any external inputs or state changes do not bypass the terminal condition checks to maintain game integrity.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Be cautious of race conditions where multiple states might change simultaneously, leading to inconsistent terminal state evaluations.

**Example Usage**
```python
# Example usage within a DiplomacyState object
class DiplomacyState:
    def __init__(self):
        self.termination_conditions = False  # Example internal state

    def is_terminal(self) -> bool:
        """Whether the game has ended."""
        return self.termination_conditions

# Creating an instance and checking terminal condition
state = DiplomacyState()
state.termination_conditions = True  # Simulate a terminal condition
print(state.is_terminal())  # Output: True
```

This example demonstrates how `is_terminal` can be used to check the game's state for termination conditions within the `DiplomacyState` class.

### FunctionDef observation(self)
**Function Overview**
The `observation` function returns the current state observation in the context of a Diplomacy game. This function is part of the `DiplomacyState` class, which manages the state of the game.

**Parameters**
- None

**Return Values**
- A `utils.Observation` object representing the current state of the game.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `observation` method in the `DiplomacyState` class is responsible for generating and returning the observation data. This function does not take any parameters, as it relies on the internal state of the `DiplomacyState` instance to construct the observation.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the `observation` function works:
1. The method initializes or retrieves the current game state.
2. It then constructs an `utils.Observation` object based on this state, which includes relevant information such as player positions, resource distribution, and other pertinent details.
3. Finally, it returns the constructed observation.

The internal logic of constructing the `Observation` object involves accessing various attributes and methods within the `DiplomacyState` class to gather all necessary data points for the current game state.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- The `observation` method interacts with other components in the project, such as the `utils.Observation` class, which is responsible for defining the structure of the observation data.
- It also relies on methods and attributes within the `DiplomacyState` class to access the current game state.

**Usage Notes**
- The function should be called whenever an update to the game state is required or when a new observation needs to be generated.
- Ensure that the internal state of the `DiplomacyState` instance is up-to-date before calling this method, as it relies on the current game state for its output.
- Performance considerations are minimal since the function does not perform any complex operations; however, if the game state becomes very large or complex, optimization might be necessary.

**Example Usage**
Here is a simple example demonstrating how to use the `observation` method:

```python
# Assuming an instance of DiplomacyState has been created and initialized
diplomacy_state = DiplomacyState()

# Generate and retrieve the current observation
current_observation = diplomacy_state.observation()
print(current_observation)
```

In this example, a new `DiplomacyState` instance is created and initialized. The `observation` method is then called to generate the current state observation, which is printed out for inspection.

This documentation provides a clear understanding of how the `observation` function works within the context of the `DiplomacyState` class and its interactions with other components in the project.
***
### FunctionDef legal_actions(self)
**Function Overview**
The `legal_actions` function returns a list of legal unit actions for each power in the game state. This function provides detailed information on all possible actions that can be taken by units controlled by different powers.

**Parameters**
- None: The function does not accept any parameters or attributes directly within its definition. It relies on internal state to determine the legality of actions.

**Return Values**
- A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a power (Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey) and contains sequences of legal unit actions for all units controlled by that power. The sublists are sorted alphabetically by power name.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `legal_actions` function operates as follows:
1. **Initialization**: It initializes a list to hold the results.
2. **Power Iteration**: It iterates over each power in alphabetical order (Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey).
3. **Action Generation**: For each power, it generates all possible unit actions that are legal within the current game state. This involves checking various conditions such as movement constraints, resource availability, and strategic considerations.
4. **Sublist Construction**: It constructs a sublist for each power containing these legal actions.
5. **Result Compilation**: The sublists are appended to the main list of results.
6. **Return**: Finally, it returns the compiled list of lists.

The function ensures that only valid actions are included in the output, reflecting the current state of the game and the rules governing unit behavior.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- This function interacts with the internal state of `DiplomacyState` to determine the legality of each action.
- It may call other methods or access attributes within the `DiplomacyState` class to gather necessary information about the game state, such as unit positions, resources, and strategic constraints.

**Usage Notes**
- **Preconditions**: The function assumes that the `DiplomacyState` object is properly initialized with a valid game state.
- **Performance Considerations**: The complexity of generating legal actions can vary based on the number of units and powers. For large games, this function may need optimization to handle performance efficiently.
- **Security Considerations**: Ensure that the internal state accessed by `legal_actions` does not expose sensitive information or violate security policies.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Be cautious when modifying the game state outside of this function, as it relies on a consistent internal state.

**Example Usage**
```python
# Assuming 'game_state' is an instance of DiplomacyState
actions = game_state.legal_actions()
for power, actions in enumerate(actions):
    print(f"Power {power} has legal actions: {actions}")
```

This example demonstrates how to call the `legal_actions` method and iterate over the returned list to inspect the legal actions for each power.
***
### FunctionDef returns(self)
**Function Overview**
The `returns` function in the `DiplomacyState` class returns an array representing the game's cumulative rewards or returns. If the game is still in progress, it returns an array filled entirely with zeros.

**Parameters**
- None

**Return Values**
- A NumPy array (`np.ndarray`) of zeros if the game is not over. The length of this array corresponds to the number of players or states involved in the game.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `returns` function checks the current state of the game through some internal logic (not explicitly shown in the provided code). If the game has ended, it returns a NumPy array filled with zeros. This behavior is consistent across all instances of the `DiplomacyState` class where the game status indicates an ongoing condition.

The function uses the following steps:
1. **Check Game Status**: The internal logic determines whether the game has concluded.
2. **Return Zeros Array**: If the game is still in progress, it returns a NumPy array of zeros with a length corresponding to the number of players or states involved.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- This function interacts with other components that manage the game state and evaluate outcomes. It relies on the `DiplomacyState` class's internal state management to determine if the game is over.
- The returned array may be used in various parts of the project, such as calculating player scores or updating game statistics.

**Usage Notes**
- **Preconditions**: Ensure that the `DiplomacyState` instance represents a valid game state. The function assumes that the internal state management accurately reflects whether the game has concluded.
- **Performance Considerations**: This function is simple and does not involve complex operations, making it efficient for use in real-time scenarios.
- **Security Considerations**: There are no security concerns with this function as it only returns a static array based on the game status.

**Example Usage**
Here is an example of how you might call the `returns` method within your code:

```python
import numpy as np

# Assuming diplomacy_state is an instance of DiplomacyState
diplomacy_state = DiplomacyState()  # Initialize with appropriate state

# Check if the game has ended and get returns
if not diplomacy_state.is_game_over():
    print("Game is still in progress, no returns to calculate.")
else:
    returns_array = diplomacy_state.returns()
    print(f"Returns array: {returns_array}")
```

In this example, `diplomacy_state` is an instance of the `DiplomacyState` class. The code checks if the game has ended using a hypothetical method `is_game_over()`. If the game is still in progress, it prints a message indicating that no returns can be calculated. Otherwise, it retrieves and prints the returns array.
***
### FunctionDef step(self, actions_per_player)
**Function Overview**
The `step` function advances the environment through a full phase of Diplomacy by processing actions from each player.

**Parameters**
- **actions_per_player**: A list of length 7, where each element is a sublist representing the unit-actions for one of the seven players (Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey). Each sublist contains integers corresponding to the specific actions taken by that player during the phase.

**Return Values**
- None. The function updates the state of the environment in place without returning any value.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `step` function processes a full phase of the Diplomacy game based on the actions provided by each player. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Validation**: The function expects a list of 7 sublists, one for each power. Each sublist contains integers representing unit-actions.
2. **Action Processing**:
    - For each player (sublist in `actions_per_player`), the function processes their actions sequentially.
3. **State Update**:
    - The function updates the internal state of the environment to reflect these actions, including changes in units' positions, status, and interactions between players.
4. **Phase Completion**: After processing all 7 sublists (one for each player), the function completes the current phase by advancing to the next phase or concluding the game if applicable.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- The `step` function interacts with other components of the `DiplomacyState` class, such as updating unit positions and statuses.
- It may also interact with external systems like a database or UI to store or display updated state information.

**Usage Notes**
- **Preconditions**: Ensure that `actions_per_player` is correctly structured as described. Incorrect structure will lead to undefined behavior.
- **Performance Considerations**: The function processes all actions in one go, which may impact performance if the number of players and actions increases significantly.
- **Edge Cases**: If any sublist in `actions_per_player` is empty or has an incorrect length, the function's behavior might be unexpected. Ensure that all sublists are correctly formatted.

**Example Usage**
Here is a simple example demonstrating how to use the `step` function:

```python
from diplomacy_state import DiplomacyState

# Initialize the state with some initial conditions
state = DiplomacyState()

# Define actions for each player (example actions)
actions_per_player = [
    [1, 2],  # Austria's actions
    [3, 4],  # England's actions
    [5, 6],  # France's actions
    [7, 8],  # Germany's actions
    [9, 10], # Italy's actions
    [11, 12],# Russia's actions
    [13, 14] # Turkey's actions
]

# Step the environment forward a full phase of Diplomacy
state.step(actions_per_player)
```

This example initializes a `DiplomacyState` object and provides sample actions for each player. The `step` function then processes these actions to update the state accordingly.
