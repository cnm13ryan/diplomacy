## ClassDef DiplomacyState
**DiplomacyState**: The function of DiplomacyState is to define a protocol for managing the state of a Diplomacy game environment.

attributes: The attributes of this Class.
· No explicit attributes are defined; instead, it specifies methods that must be implemented by any class adhering to this protocol.

Code Description: The description of this Class.
DiplomacyState is an abstract class defined as a Protocol using the typing_extensions module. It outlines the necessary interface for classes representing the state of a Diplomacy game environment. This protocol includes five methods:
- `is_terminal`: A method that returns a boolean indicating whether the game has ended.
- `observation`: A method that provides the current observation of the game state, returning an object of type `utils.Observation`.
- `legal_actions`: A method that returns a list of lists representing all legal unit actions for each power in the game. The powers are listed alphabetically (Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey), and each sublist contains all possible actions for that power's units.
- `returns`: A method that returns an array of returns from the game. If the game is still in progress, this will be an array filled with zeros.
- `step`: A method that advances the game environment by one full phase, taking as input a list of lists where each sublist contains actions for all units of a specific power.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
Implementing classes must provide concrete implementations for all methods defined in this protocol. This ensures consistency and interoperability across different Diplomacy game environments that adhere to the DiplomacyState protocol.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
- `is_terminal` might return `False` if the game is ongoing or `True` if it has ended.
- `observation` could return an instance of `utils.Observation`, which encapsulates all relevant information about the current state of the game.
- `legal_actions` might return a structure like `[[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6]], ...]`, where each sublist corresponds to a power and contains lists representing possible actions for that power's units.
- `returns` could return an array such as `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` during gameplay or `[1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` indicating the outcome of a game where one player has won.
- `step` does not return any value but modifies the internal state of the environment based on the provided actions.
### FunctionDef is_terminal(self)
**is_terminal**: The function of is_terminal is to determine whether the game has ended.
parameters: This Function does not take any parameters.
Code Description: The method `is_terminal` is designed to return a boolean value indicating the end state of the game. Currently, the implementation is incomplete as it contains only a pass statement and lacks the logic necessary to evaluate the game's terminal condition. Developers are expected to fill in this function with appropriate conditions that define when the game should be considered over.
Note: Points to note about the use of the code include ensuring that the function is properly implemented to accurately reflect the end state of the game. Failure to do so may result in incorrect behavior or logic errors within the application.
***
### FunctionDef observation(self)
**observation**: The function of observation is to return the current observation.
parameters: This Function does not take any parameters.
Code Description: The `observation` method is designed to provide access to the current state of observation within the context of the DiplomacyState class. It is intended to encapsulate and deliver the relevant data that represents the present condition or status being observed, likely in a structured format defined by the `utils.Observation` type.
Note: Points to note about the use of the code include understanding that this method does not modify any state but merely retrieves it. Developers should ensure they have a clear understanding of what constitutes an "observation" within their specific application or framework to effectively utilize the data returned by this function.
***
### FunctionDef legal_actions(self)
**legal_actions**: The function of legal_actions is to return a list of lists containing all possible unit actions that are legal for each power in the current game state.

parameters: This Function does not take any parameters.
Code Description: The function `legal_actions` is designed to provide a structured representation of all feasible actions available to each player (referred to as powers) in the context of the current diplomatic state. The output is organized into seven sub-lists, corresponding to each power in alphabetical order: Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey. Each sub-list contains every possible action that can be performed by all units controlled by that specific power under the given circumstances.

The function returns a `Sequence[Sequence[int]]`, which means it provides a sequence (list) of sequences (lists), where each inner list represents a set of actions for a particular unit or combination of units belonging to one of the seven powers. The exact nature and format of these actions are not detailed in the provided code snippet, but they are expected to be represented as integers.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code include understanding that the function does not modify the game state; it only provides information on what actions can be legally taken. Developers should ensure that any action selected from the output of this function is applied correctly within the rules and context of the game mechanics.
***
### FunctionDef returns(self)
**returns**: The function of returns is to retrieve the returns of the game. All 0s if the game is in progress.
parameters: This Function does not take any parameters.
Code Description: The `returns` method is designed to provide an array representing the outcomes or rewards from a game. If the game has concluded, this method would typically return an array with values indicating the result (e.g., scores for each player). However, if the game is still ongoing, it returns an array filled with zeros, signifying that no final results are available yet.
Note: Ensure that the game state is correctly managed so that the `returns` method can accurately reflect whether the game has ended and provide the appropriate return values. This method relies on the internal state of the `DiplomacyState` object to determine if the game is in progress or completed.
Output Example: If the game is still ongoing, a possible output could be `np.array([0, 0, 0])`, indicating that there are three players and no final scores yet. Upon completion, it might return something like `np.array([1, -1, 0])`, suggesting Player 1 won, Player 2 lost, and Player 3 neither won nor lost.
***
### FunctionDef step(self, actions_per_player)
**step**: The function of step is to advance the Diplomacy environment by one full phase.

parameters: 
· actions_per_player: A list of lists containing unit-actions. There are seven sub-lists, each corresponding to one of the seven powers in alphabetical order (Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey). Each sublist contains all the actions for that player's units during the current phase.

Code Description: The step function is designed to progress the Diplomacy game environment by executing a full phase based on the provided actions. It accepts a structured input where each power's actions are grouped together in a specific order. This ensures that the simulation can accurately reflect the strategic decisions made by each player during their turn. Although the function currently has no implementation (as indicated by the pass statement), its intended purpose is to update the game state according to the rules of Diplomacy, incorporating all specified actions and resolving any conflicts or outcomes resulting from those actions.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code include ensuring that the input parameter adheres strictly to the expected format with seven sub-lists in alphabetical order. Each sublist must contain valid unit-actions for the corresponding power. Failure to provide correctly formatted data may lead to errors or unexpected behavior once the function is fully implemented.
