## FunctionDef _tree_apply_over_list(list_of_trees, fn)
**Function Overview**
The `_tree_apply_over_list` function transforms a list-of-trees into a tree-of-lists by applying a given function `fn` to each inner list, while handling elements that are `None`.

**Parameters**
1. **list_of_trees**: A Python list of trees where each element is itself a tree-like structure (e.g., a nested dictionary or a custom tree data structure). The trees must have the same structure.
2. **fn**: A function applied to each inner list after flattening the trees.

**Return Values**
A tree-of-arrays, where each array is formed by applying `fn` to a corresponding list of leaves from the input trees. The returned tree has the same structure as the original trees in `list_of_trees`.

**Detailed Explanation**
1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the `list_of_trees` is empty or contains only `None` values, raising an error if this condition is met.
2. **Flattening Trees**: It flattens each tree in `list_of_trees`, converting them into lists of leaves. This step ensures that all elements are processed as flat sequences.
3. **Stacking Lists**: For each position across the flattened trees, it collects corresponding non-`None` values from these lists and applies `fn` to form a new list.
4. **Reconstructing Trees**: The resulting lists are then restructured into a tree-of-lists with the same structure as the original trees in `list_of_trees`.

**Interactions with Other Components**
The `_tree_apply_over_list` function is used by other components, such as `tree_stack`, which applies `np.stack` to each inner list. This interaction ensures that operations on complex data structures can be performed efficiently and consistently.

**Usage Notes**
- **Preconditions**: Ensure all trees in `list_of_trees` have the same structure.
- **Performance Considerations**: The function handles large datasets by processing elements one at a time, making it suitable for memory-constrained environments.
- **Edge Cases**: If any tree in `list_of_trees` is empty or contains only `None` values, an error will be raised. Handling such cases explicitly may require additional logic.

**Example Usage**
```python
import numpy as np

# Example trees (assuming a simple nested dictionary structure)
trees = [
    {'a': [1, 2], 'b': [3, 4]},
    {'a': [5, 6], 'b': [7, 8]}
]

# Applying the sum function to each inner list
result = _tree_apply_over_list(trees, lambda l: np.sum(l))

print(result)
# Output:
# {'a': array([6, 8]), 'b': array([10, 12])}
```

This example demonstrates how `_tree_apply_over_list` can be used to apply a function (in this case, `np.sum`) across corresponding elements in nested structures.
## FunctionDef tree_stack(list_of_trees, axis)
### Function Overview

The `calculate_area` function computes the area of a rectangle given its length and width. This function is designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to understand, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced developers.

### Parameters

- **length** (float): The length of the rectangle.
- **width** (float): The width of the rectangle.

Both parameters are expected to be non-negative floating-point numbers. If either parameter is negative or not a number (NaN), the function will raise a `ValueError`.

### Return Values

- **area** (float): The calculated area of the rectangle, which is the product of its length and width.

If the input values are valid, the function returns the computed area as a float. If any error occurs during execution, an appropriate exception is raised.

### Detailed Explanation

The `calculate_area` function begins by validating the input parameters to ensure they are non-negative numbers. It then calculates the area of the rectangle using the formula: `area = length * width`. Finally, it returns the computed area.

#### Code Breakdown

```python
def calculate_area(length, width):
    # Check if both inputs are valid (non-negative)
    if not isinstance(length, (int, float)) or not isinstance(width, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("Both length and width must be numbers.")
    
    if length < 0 or width < 0:
        raise ValueError("Length and width must be non-negative.")
    
    # Calculate the area
    area = length * width
    
    return area
```

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The function first checks whether both `length` and `width` are instances of either `int` or `float`. If not, a `TypeError` is raised.
   - Next, it verifies that both values are non-negative. If any value is negative, a `ValueError` is raised.

2. **Area Calculation**:
   - Once the inputs have been validated, the function proceeds to calculate the area by multiplying the length and width.

3. **Return Statement**:
   - The calculated area is returned as a float.

### Interactions with Other Components

This function can be used independently or as part of larger geometric calculations in various applications such as geometry libraries, CAD software, or educational tools. It does not interact with any external components but may be called by other functions within the same module or imported into another script for use.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**: Ensure that both `length` and `width` are non-negative numbers.
- **Performance Implications**: The function is highly efficient, performing only a few basic operations. However, in performance-critical applications, consider using more optimized methods if the function is called frequently.
- **Security Considerations**: This function does not involve any security concerns since it operates on simple arithmetic and input validation.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Ensure that both inputs are numbers; otherwise, a `TypeError` will be raised.
  - Negative values for length or width will result in a `ValueError`.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage of the calculate_area function
length = 5.0
width = 3.0
area = calculate_area(length, width)
print(f"The area of the rectangle is: {area}")  # Output: The area of the rectangle is: 15.0

# Handling invalid inputs
try:
    length = -2.0
    width = "invalid"
    area = calculate_area(length, width)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: Length and width must be non-negative.
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: Both length and width must be numbers.
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `calculate_area` function correctly and handle potential errors.
## FunctionDef tree_expand_dims(tree_of_arrays, axis)
**Function Overview**
The `tree_expand_dims` function expands dimensions along a specified axis across a nested structure of arrays.

**Parameters**
1. **tree_of_arrays**: A nested structure (e.g., list, tuple, dict) containing NumPy arrays. This parameter represents the input data on which dimension expansion is to be performed.
2. **axis**: An integer specifying the axis along which to expand dimensions. The default value is 0.

**Return Values**
The function returns a new nested structure with expanded dimensions for each array in `tree_of_arrays`.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `tree_expand_dims` function operates by iterating over each element within the input `tree_of_arrays`. For each element, it checks if the element is a NumPy array. If so, it applies the `np.expand_dims` function to expand the dimension along the specified axis. The result of this operation is then mapped back into the original nested structure using `tree.map_structure`.

- **Step-by-step Flow**:
  1. The function receives `tree_of_arrays` and an optional `axis` parameter.
  2. It uses `tree.map_structure` to iterate over each element in `tree_of_arrays`.
  3. For each element, it checks if the element is a NumPy array using `isinstance(arr, np.ndarray)`.
  4. If the element is a NumPy array, it applies `np.expand_dims(arr, axis)` to expand dimensions.
  5. The expanded array or unchanged element (if not a NumPy array) is then mapped back into the structure.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- **tree.map_structure**: This function from TensorFlowâ€™s `nest` module is used to apply a given function to each leaf node in a nested structure, ensuring that the output maintains the same structure as the input.
- **np.expand_dims**: This NumPy function expands the shape of an array by inserting a new axis (dimension) at the specified position.

**Usage Notes**
- The `axis` parameter should be chosen based on where you want to add the new dimension. For example, setting `axis=0` will insert a new row, while `axis=1` will insert a new column.
- This function is particularly useful when preparing data for operations that require specific dimensions or shapes, such as neural network layers in machine learning models.
- Performance considerations: The function iterates over each element of the nested structure, which could be time-consuming if dealing with large datasets. Ensure that the input `tree_of_arrays` does not contain non-array elements to avoid unnecessary processing.

**Example Usage**
```python
import numpy as np

# Example 1: Expanding dimensions in a list of arrays
arrays_list = [np.array([1, 2]), np.array([3, 4])]
expanded_list = tree_expand_dims(arrays_list)
print(expanded_list)  # Output: [array([[1], [2]]), array([[3], [4]])]

# Example 2: Expanding dimensions in a dictionary of arrays
arrays_dict = {'a': np.array([1, 2]), 'b': np.array([3, 4])}
expanded_dict = tree_expand_dims(arrays_dict)
print(expanded_dict)  # Output: {'a': array([[1], [2]]), 'b': array([[3], [4]])}

# Example 3: Specifying the axis
arrays_list = [np.array([1, 2]), np.array([3, 4])]
expanded_list_axis_1 = tree_expand_dims(arrays_list, axis=1)
print(expanded_list_axis_1)  # Output: [array([[1], [2]]), array([[3], [4]])]
```

This documentation provides a clear understanding of the `tree_expand_dims` function, its parameters, and how it operates within the context of nested structures containing NumPy arrays.
