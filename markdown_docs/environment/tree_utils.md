## FunctionDef _tree_apply_over_list(list_of_trees, fn)
**_tree_apply_over_list**: The function of _tree_apply_over_list is to transform a list-of-trees into a tree-of-lists and apply a given function to each inner list, handling trees with potentially null elements.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· list_of_trees: A Python list of trees, where all trees are expected to have the same structure.
· fn: The function applied to each list of leaves in the transformed tree-of-lists.

**Code Description**: This function first checks if the input list_of_trees is empty, raising a ValueError if it is. It then flattens each tree in the list using the flatten method and stores the results in list_of_flat_trees. Next, it iterates over the positions in the flattened trees, creating new lists at each position by collecting the elements from the corresponding positions in the flattened trees. These new lists are filtered to exclude any null elements. The function fn is then applied to each of these filtered lists, and the results are collected in flat_tree_of_stacks. Finally, the function uses the unflatten_as method to transform flat_tree_of_stacks back into a tree structure, which is returned as the result. This function is used by tree_stack to stack trees while ignoring null elements, demonstrating its utility in handling incomplete or filtered data structures.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that all trees in list_of_trees have the same structure, as this function assumes a uniform tree structure for correct operation. Additionally, the function fn should be able to handle lists of varying lengths, as the filtering process may result in lists of different sizes.

**Output Example**: The output of _tree_apply_over_list will be a tree-of-arrays, where each array is formed by applying the function fn to a list of elements from the corresponding positions in the input trees. For instance, if the input list_of_trees contains two trees with structures {a: 1, b: 2} and {a: 3, b: 4}, and fn is the np.stack function, the output might be a tree with structure {a: [1, 3], b: [2, 4]}.
## FunctionDef tree_stack(list_of_trees, axis)
**tree_stack**: The function of tree_stack is to transform a list-of-trees into a tree-of-arrays by applying np.stack to each inner list, while ignoring any null elements in the trees.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· list_of_trees: A Python list of trees, where all trees are expected to have the same structure.
· axis: An optional parameter that specifies the axis argument for np.stack, which determines the dimension in the resulting array along which the input arrays are stacked.

**Code Description**: This function utilizes the _tree_apply_over_list function to transform the input list-of-trees into a tree-of-lists. It then applies np.stack to each inner list in the transformed tree, effectively stacking the elements along the specified axis. The _tree_apply_over_list function handles trees with potentially null elements by ignoring them during the stacking process. This approach ensures that the resulting tree-of-arrays only contains valid data.

The function first checks if the input list_of_trees is empty and raises a ValueError if it is, as the implementation requires at least one element to infer the tree structure. It then relies on _tree_apply_over_list to perform the actual transformation and stacking. The np.stack function is applied to each inner list in the transformed tree, with the axis parameter determining the dimension along which the input arrays are stacked.

The relationship between tree_stack and its callee, _tree_apply_over_list, is crucial from a functional perspective. The _tree_apply_over_list function provides the necessary logic for transforming the list-of-trees into a tree-of-lists and applying a given function to each inner list, while ignoring null elements. By leveraging this functionality, tree_stack can focus on stacking the input trees using np.stack, resulting in a concise and efficient implementation.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that all trees in the input list_of_trees have the same structure, as the _tree_apply_over_list function assumes a uniform tree structure for correct operation. Additionally, the axis parameter should be carefully chosen based on the desired output, as it affects the dimension along which the input arrays are stacked.

**Output Example**: The output of tree_stack will be a tree-of-arrays, where each array is formed by stacking the corresponding elements from the input trees along the specified axis. For instance, if the input list_of_trees contains two trees with structures {a: 1, b: 2} and {a: 3, b: 4}, and the axis parameter is set to 0, the output might be a tree with structure {a: [1, 3], b: [2, 4]}.
## FunctionDef tree_expand_dims(tree_of_arrays, axis)
**tree_expand_dims**: The function of tree_expand_dims is to expand dimensions along a specified axis across a tree-like structure of arrays.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· tree_of_arrays: This parameter represents the tree-like structure of arrays that needs to be expanded.
· axis: This parameter specifies the axis along which the expansion should occur, with a default value of 0 if not provided.

**Code Description**: The description of this Function. 
The tree_expand_dims function utilizes the map_structure method from the tree module to apply the np.expand_dims operation to each array within the tree_of_arrays structure. This allows for the expansion of dimensions along the specified axis across all arrays in the tree-like structure, while maintaining the original structure.

**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code. 
It is essential to ensure that the input tree_of_arrays is a valid tree-like structure and that the axis parameter is a valid integer. Additionally, the np.expand_dims function from the NumPy library is used, so it must be available in the environment.

**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
The output will be a new tree-like structure with the same shape as the input tree_of_arrays but with an additional dimension added along the specified axis. For instance, if the input array has a shape of (3, 4) and the axis is set to 0, the output array will have a shape of (1, 3, 4). The exact structure and shape will depend on the specific input tree_of_arrays and the value of the axis parameter.
