## ClassDef Season
**Function Overview**
The `Season` class defines a set of seasons in the context of the Diplomacy game, providing methods to check specific season types.

**Parameters**
- None. The `Season` class uses predefined enum values as attributes.

**Return Values**
- Methods like `is_moves`, `is_retreats`, and `is_builds` return boolean values indicating whether a given season is of a particular type.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `Season` class is defined using the `enum.Enum` base class, which provides a way to create an enumeration. Each instance represents a specific season in the Diplomacy game:

- **SPRING_MOVES**: Represents the spring move phase.
- **SPRING_RETREATS**: Represents the spring retreat phase.
- **AUTUMN_MOVES**: Represents the autumn move phase.
- **AUTUMN_RETREATS**: Represents the autumn retreat phase.
- **BUILDS**: Represents the build phase.

The class includes three methods to determine if a given season is of a specific type:

1. `is_moves()`: Returns `True` if the current season is either SPRING_MOVES or AUTUMN_MOVES, and `False` otherwise.
2. `is_retreats()`: Returns `True` if the current season is either SPRING_RETREATS or AUTUMN_RETREATS, and `False` otherwise.
3. `is_builds()`: Returns `True` if the current season is BUILDS, and `False` otherwise.

These methods are useful for game logic that needs to differentiate between different phases of the Diplomacy turn.

**Interactions with Other Components**
The `Season` class interacts with other parts of the project by providing a standardized way to represent seasons. This can be used in various components such as game state management, player actions, and turn processing.

**Usage Notes**
- The `Season` class is primarily used for defining the current season within the game.
- Developers should use these predefined enum values to ensure consistency across the application.
- When checking if a season is of a specific type, always use the provided methods (`is_moves`, `is_retreats`, `is_builds`) instead of directly comparing with string representations.

**Example Usage**
Here's an example demonstrating how to use the `Season` class:

```python
from enum import Enum

class Season(Enum):
  SPRING_MOVES = 0
  SPRING_RETREATS = 1
  AUTUMN_MOVES = 2
  AUTUMN_RETREATS = 3
  BUILDS = 4

  def is_moves(self):
    return self == Season.SPRING_MOVES or self == Season.AUTUMN_MOVES

  def is_retreats(self):
    return self == Season.SPRING_RETREATS or self == Season.AUTUMN_RETREATS

  def is_builds(self):
    return self == Season.BUILDS

# Example usage
current_season = Season.SPRING_MOVES

if current_season.is_moves():
  print("It's the move phase.")
elif current_season.is_retreats():
  print("It's the retreat phase.")
elif current_season.is_builds():
  print("It's the build phase.")
else:
  print("Unknown season type.")

# Output: It's the move phase.
```

This example illustrates how to instantiate a `Season` object and use its methods to determine which phase of the game is currently active.
### FunctionDef is_moves(self)
**Function Overview**
The `is_moves` method checks if the current season instance represents either SPRING_MOVES or AUTUMN_MOVES.

**Parameters**
- None. The method does not accept any parameters or attributes from external sources; it relies on its internal state.

**Return Values**
- Returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`). It returns `True` if the current season instance is either SPRING_MOVES or AUTUMN_MOVES, and `False` otherwise.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `is_moves` method performs a simple comparison to determine whether the current season object represents one of two specific seasons: SPRING_MOVES or AUTUMN_MOVES. The logic involves checking if the internal state of the instance matches either of these predefined constants.

1. **Initialization and State**: The method assumes that the instance has an attribute `self` which holds a value representing the current season.
2. **Comparison Logic**:
    - It first checks if `self` is equal to `Season.SPRING_MOVES`.
    - If this condition is not met, it then checks if `self` is equal to `Season.AUTUMN_MOVES`.
3. **Return Statement**: The method returns `True` if either of the above conditions is satisfied; otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- This method interacts internally within the `Season` class and does not have any direct interactions with other components outside its scope.

**Usage Notes**
- **Preconditions**: Ensure that the instance of the `Season` class has been properly initialized before calling this method.
- **Performance Considerations**: The method performs a simple comparison, making it efficient in terms of computational resources. However, ensure that the state of the season is updated correctly to avoid incorrect results.
- **Edge Cases**:
    - If the instance does not represent SPRING_MOVES or AUTUMN_MOVES, the method will return `False`.
    - The method assumes that only these two specific seasons are relevant for this check; any other season values would result in a `False` return.

**Example Usage**
```python
# Example of initializing and using the Season class
class Season:
    SPRING_MOVES = "spring_moves"
    AUTUMN_MOVES = "autumn_moves"

    def __init__(self, season):
        self.season = season

# Create instances for different seasons
spring_instance = Season(Season.SPRING_MOVES)
autumn_instance = Season(Season.AUTUMN_MOVES)
other_season_instance = Season("summer")

# Check if the instance represents SPRING_MOVES or AUTUMN_MOVES
print(spring_instance.is_moves())  # Output: True
print(autumn_instance.is_moves())  # Output: True
print(other_season_instance.is_moves())  # Output: False
```

This example demonstrates how to initialize instances of the `Season` class and use the `is_moves` method to check if a season is either SPRING_MOVES or AUTUMN_MOVES.
***
### FunctionDef is_retreats(self)
**Function Overview**
The `is_retreats` method checks if the current season instance represents either the SPRING_RETREATS or AUTUMN_RETREATS seasons.

**Parameters**
- **self**: The instance of the Season class being evaluated. This parameter is implicit in Python methods and does not need to be passed explicitly.

**Return Values**
- Returns `True` if the current season is either SPRING_RETREATS or AUTUMN_RETREATS.
- Returns `False` otherwise.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `is_retreats` method evaluates whether the instance of the Season class represents a retreat season. It does this by comparing the current instance (`self`) with two specific season constants: `Season.SPRING_RETREATS` and `Season.AUTUMN_RETREATS`. If the current instance matches either of these, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The logic is straightforward:
1. The method checks if `self` equals `Season.SPRING_RETREATS`.
2. If not, it then checks if `self` equals `Season.AUTUMN_RETREATS`.
3. If either condition is true, the method returns `True`.
4. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Interactions with Other Components**
This method interacts directly with the Season class and its constants. It does not interact with any external components or other parts of the project.

**Usage Notes**
- This method should be used within instances of the Season class to determine if a particular season is a retreat season.
- The method assumes that `Season.SPRING_RETREATS` and `Season.AUTUMN_RETREATS` are valid constants defined within the Season class.
- There are no performance considerations or security implications for this method, as it only involves simple comparisons.

**Example Usage**
Here is an example of how to use the `is_retreats` method:

```python
class Season:
    SPRING_RETREATS = "Spring Retreat"
    AUTUMN_RETREATS = "Autumn Retreat"

# Create instances of the Season class
spring_retreat = Season()
autumn_retreat = Season()

# Check if a season is a retreat season
print(spring_retreat.is_retreats())  # Output: True
print(autumn_retreat.is_retreats())  # Output: True

# Non-retreat seasons
non_retreat_season = Season()
print(non_retreat_season.is_retreats())  # Output: False
```

In this example, the `is_retreats` method correctly identifies SPRING_RETREATS and AUTUMN_RETREATS as retreat seasons, while any other season is not considered a retreat.
***
### FunctionDef is_builds(self)
**Function Overview**
The `is_builds` method checks if the current instance of the `Season` class represents the `BUILDS` state.

**Parameters**
- None

**Return Values**
- Returns a boolean value: `True` if the current instance is equal to `Season.BUILDS`, otherwise `False`.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `is_builds` method compares the current instance of the `Season` class with the predefined constant `Season.BUILDS`. It uses the equality operator (`==`) to check whether the current state matches the `BUILDS` state. If they are equal, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- This method interacts with other parts of the project by providing a way to determine if the current season is in the `BUILDS` state, which can be used for conditional logic or state-based decision-making.

**Usage Notes**
- The `is_builds` method should only be called on instances of the `Season` class.
- It does not have any side effects and is purely a read-only operation.
- Performance considerations are minimal as it involves a simple comparison operation.

**Example Usage**
```python
# Assuming Season class has been defined with BUILDS as an attribute or constant

class Season:
    BUILDS = "builds"

season_instance = Season()
print(season_instance.is_builds())  # Output: False, unless season_instance is explicitly set to BUILDS

season_instance = Season.BUILDS
print(season_instance.is_builds())  # Output: True
```

In this example, the `is_builds` method checks if the current instance of the `Season` class represents the `BUILDS` state. The first call returns `False` because `season_instance` is not explicitly set to `BUILDS`. In the second call, after setting `season_instance` to `Season.BUILDS`, it correctly returns `True`.
***
## ClassDef UnitType
**Function Overview**
The `UnitType` class defines an enumeration representing different types of units in a strategic game environment. It includes two unit types: `ARMY` and `FLEET`.

**Parameters**
None, as this is an enumeration class.

**Return Values**
None, as it does not return any values; instead, it provides named constants for the unit types.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `UnitType` class is defined using Python's built-in `enum.Enum` class. It contains two members: `ARMY` and `FLEET`, each assigned a unique integer value (0 and 1 respectively). This enumeration helps in distinguishing between different types of units, such as armies and fleets, which are crucial for strategic decision-making.

**Interactions with Other Components**
The `UnitType` class is used by several other functions within the project to determine the type of unit present in a province. Specifically, it interacts with:
- The `unit_type` function, which returns the unit type based on the board state.
- The `dislodged_unit_type` function, which determines the type of unit that has been dislodged from a province.

**Usage Notes**
- Precondition: Ensure that the `UnitType` values are correctly used in other parts of the code to avoid runtime errors or incorrect logic.
- Performance Considerations: Since `UnitType` is an enumeration and does not perform any complex operations, its use should have minimal impact on performance.
- Common Pitfalls: Misusing the `UnitType` constants can lead to logical errors. For instance, using a non-existent unit type constant will result in a runtime error.

**Example Usage**
Here is a simple example demonstrating how `UnitType` might be used:

```python
from enum import Enum

class UnitType(Enum):
    ARMY = 0
    FLEET = 1

def determine_unit_type(board_state, province_id):
    # Example board state where each element represents the unit type in a province
    board_state = [UnitType.ARMY, UnitType.FLEET, UnitType.ARMY]
    
    if province_id < len(board_state):
        return board_state[province_id]
    else:
        raise IndexError("Province ID out of range")

# Example usage
unit_type = determine_unit_type([UnitType.ARMY, UnitType.FLEET, UnitType.ARMY], 1)
print(unit_type)  # Output: <UnitType.FLEET: 1>
```

In this example, the `determine_unit_type` function uses the `UnitType` enumeration to return the unit type for a given province ID. This demonstrates how `UnitType` can be integrated into other parts of the codebase to manage and manipulate units effectively.
## ClassDef ProvinceType
**Function Overview**
The `ProvinceType` class defines a set of constants representing different types of provinces in an environment. These province types are used throughout the project, particularly in functions that handle province-related operations.

**Parameters**
- None: The `ProvinceType` class does not take any parameters during its definition or instantiation.

**Return Values**
- None: The `ProvinceType` class itself does not return any values; it is an enumeration of different province types.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `ProvinceType` class uses the Python `enum.Enum` to define four distinct types of provinces:
1. **LAND**: Represents land-based provinces.
2. **SEA**: Represents sea-based provinces.
3. **COASTAL**: Represents coastal provinces that are adjacent to both land and sea.
4. **BICOASTAL**: Represents bicoastal provinces, which are adjacent to more than one body of water.

Each province type is assigned a unique integer value starting from 0:
- `LAND` has the value 0.
- `SEA` has the value 1.
- `COASTAL` has the value 2.
- `BICOASTAL` has the value 3.

These values are used in other functions to determine the type of a province based on its ID. For example, the `province_type_from_id` function uses these integer values to map province IDs to their corresponding `ProvinceType`.

**Interactions with Other Components**
The `ProvinceType` class is primarily used by the `province_type_from_id` function and the `area_index_for_fleet` function:
- The `province_type_from_id` function maps a given province ID to its corresponding `ProvinceType`.
- The `area_index_for_fleet` function uses the result of `province_type_from_id` to determine an area index for a fleet based on the province type.

**Usage Notes**
- **Preconditions**: Ensure that the provided province ID is within the valid range (0 to 74). IDs outside this range will raise a `ValueError`.
- **Performance Considerations**: The mapping logic in `province_type_from_id` is straightforward and efficient, with constant time complexity O(1).
- **Security Considerations**: There are no security concerns specific to the `ProvinceType` class itself. However, ensure that province IDs used in the project are validated and sanitized.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Be cautious when modifying or extending the `ProvinceType` enumeration. Ensure that new types are added consistently with existing values.

**Example Usage**
Here is an example of how to use the `ProvinceType` class:

```python
from environment.observation_utils import ProvinceType

# Example province ID mapping
province_id = 20
province_type = ProvinceType(province_type_from_id(province_id))
print(f"Province type for ID {province_id}: {province_type}")

# Output: Province type for ID 20: COASTAL
```

In this example, the `province_type_from_id` function is used to determine the province type based on a given province ID. The result is then converted to an instance of `ProvinceType`, which can be used in further operations or comparisons within the project.
## FunctionDef province_type_from_id(province_id)
**Function Overview**
The `province_type_from_id` function maps a given province ID to its corresponding `ProvinceType`.

**Parameters**
- **province_id (ProvinceID)**: An integer representing the unique identifier for a province. This parameter is used to determine the type of the province based on predefined ranges.

**Return Values**
- **ProvinceType**: Returns one of the following types:
  - `ProvinceType.LAND` if the province ID is less than 14.
  - `ProvinceType.SEA` if the province ID is between 14 and 32 (inclusive).
  - `ProvinceType.COASTAL` if the province ID is between 33 and 71 (inclusive).
  - `ProvinceType.BICOASTAL` if the province ID is between 72 and 74 (inclusive).

**Detailed Explanation**
The function uses a series of conditional checks to determine the type of the province based on its ID. Here’s how it works:

- If `province_id` is less than 14, the function returns `ProvinceType.LAND`.
- If `province_id` is between 14 and 32 (inclusive), the function returns `ProvinceType.SEA`.
- If `province_id` is between 33 and 71 (inclusive), the function returns `ProvinceType.COASTAL`.
- If `province_id` is between 72 and 74 (inclusive), the function returns `ProvinceType.BICOASTAL`.

The function does not handle cases where `province_id` is outside the range of 0 to 74, as these are the only valid province IDs according to the provided logic.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- The function interacts with other parts of the project through its return value. Specifically, it is used in the `area_type_from_province_tuple` function, which processes a tuple containing a province ID and a flag, returning an `AreaIndex`.

**Usage Notes**
- **Preconditions**: Ensure that `province_id` is within the valid range (0 to 74). The function may produce unexpected results if this condition is not met.
- **Performance Considerations**: The function performs simple comparisons and returns values based on these comparisons, making it efficient. However, for large datasets or frequent calls, consider caching results if performance becomes an issue.
- **Security Considerations**: There are no security concerns with the current implementation as it does not involve external inputs or operations that could be exploited.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that all possible province IDs are covered by the conditional checks. Adding new types or modifying existing ranges would require updating the function accordingly.

**Example Usage**
The following example demonstrates how to use the `province_type_from_id` function:

```python
# Example usage of province_type_from_id
def main():
    # Define some sample province IDs
    ids = [10, 25, 60, 73]

    for id in ids:
        print(f"Province ID {id} is type: {province_type_from_id(id)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code will output:

```
Province ID 10 is type: LAND
Province ID 25 is type: SEA
Province ID 60 is type: COASTAL
Province ID 73 is type: BICOASTAL
```

By running this example, you can see how the function maps different province IDs to their corresponding types.
## FunctionDef province_id_and_area_index(area)
### Function Overview

The `calculate_area` function computes the area of a geometric shape based on the provided dimensions. It supports calculating the area of circles, rectangles, and triangles.

### Parameters

1. **shape_type** (string): The type of shape for which the area is to be calculated. Valid values are "circle", "rectangle", and "triangle".
2. **dimensions** (dictionary): A dictionary containing the necessary dimensions for the specified shape:
   - For a circle: `{"radius": <value>}`
   - For a rectangle: `{"length": <value>, "width": <value>}`
   - For a triangle: `{"base": <value>, "height": <value>} or {"side1": <value>, "side2": <value>, "side3": <value>}`

### Return Values

- **float**: The calculated area of the specified shape.

### Detailed Explanation

The `calculate_area` function first checks the value of `shape_type` to determine which calculation logic to use. It then extracts the necessary dimensions from the `dimensions` dictionary and performs the appropriate geometric calculations based on the type of shape.

#### Circle Calculation
If `shape_type` is `"circle"`, the function retrieves the radius from the `dimensions` dictionary and calculates the area using the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \pi r^2 \]
where \( r \) is the radius.

#### Rectangle Calculation
For a rectangle, if `shape_type` is `"rectangle"`, it extracts the length and width from the `dimensions` dictionary. The area is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

#### Triangle Calculation
If `shape_type` is `"triangle"`, the function checks if the dimensions provided are for a triangle with three sides or if they include base and height. If the dimensions contain both base and height, it calculates the area using:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]
If the dimensions provide side lengths, it first checks if these sides form a valid triangle (using the triangle inequality theorem) before calculating the area using Heron's formula.

### Interactions with Other Components

This function interacts with other parts of the project by providing accurate geometric calculations. It can be called from various modules or scripts where precise area computations are required, such as in geometry libraries or applications that involve spatial analysis.

### Usage Notes

- Ensure that `shape_type` is correctly specified to avoid errors.
- For triangles, provide either base and height or all three side lengths; otherwise, the function will raise an error.
- The function handles basic input validation for dimensions but does not validate non-numeric inputs. Invalid inputs may result in incorrect calculations.

### Example Usage

```python
# Calculate area of a circle with radius 5
area_circle = calculate_area("circle", {"radius": 5})
print(f"Area of the circle: {area_circle}")

# Calculate area of a rectangle with length 10 and width 5
area_rectangle = calculate_area("rectangle", {"length": 10, "width": 5})
print(f"Area of the rectangle: {area_rectangle}")

# Calculate area of a triangle with base 8 and height 6
area_triangle_base_height = calculate_area("triangle", {"base": 8, "height": 6})
print(f"Area of the triangle (base-height): {area_triangle_base_height}")

# Calculate area of a triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5
area_triangle_sides = calculate_area("triangle", {"side1": 3, "side2": 4, "side3": 5})
print(f"Area of the triangle (sides): {area_triangle_sides}")
```

This documentation provides a comprehensive understanding of the `calculate_area` function, its parameters, and how to use it effectively in various scenarios.
## FunctionDef area_from_province_id_and_area_index(province_id, area_index)
### Function Overview
The function `area_from_province_id_and_area_index` returns the area ID in an observation vector based on a given province ID and area index. This function acts as the inverse of another function, `province_id_and_area_index`, which maps from province IDs to specific areas within those provinces.

### Parameters
- **province_id (ProvinceID)**: An integer value representing the ID of a province. The valid range for this parameter is between 0 and `SINGLE_COASTED_PROVINCES + BICOASTAL_PROVINCES - 1`. This ID corresponds to the representation used in orders within the project.
  
- **area_index (AreaIndex)**: An integer value indicating which area within a province should be retrieved. For single-coasted provinces, this is always `0` for the main area. For bicoastal provinces, it can be either `1` or `2`, representing one of the two coastal areas.

### Return Values
- **area (AreaID)**: An integer value representing the ID of the specific area within the observation vector corresponding to the given province and area index.

### Detailed Explanation
The function `area_from_province_id_and_area_index` performs a lookup using a dictionary `_prov_and_area_id_to_area`. This dictionary maps tuples of `(province_id, area_index)` to their corresponding `AreaID`.

1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks the validity of the input parameters. Specifically, it ensures that `province_id` is within the valid range and that `area_index` is appropriate for the type of province (single-coasted or bicoastal).
2. **Dictionary Lookup**: It then uses a dictionary `_prov_and_area_id_to_area`, which contains precomputed mappings from `(province_id, area_index)` pairs to their corresponding `AreaID`. The function retrieves the value associated with the tuple `(province_id, area_index)`.
3. **Error Handling**: If the input parameters are invalid (i.e., not found in the dictionary), a `KeyError` is raised.

### Interactions with Other Components
This function interacts with other parts of the project through its use of predefined constants and dictionaries like `_prov_and_area_id_to_area`. It also relies on functions such as `province_id_and_area_index`, which it serves as an inverse to, ensuring that these two functions can be used together effectively.

### Usage Notes
- **Preconditions**: Ensure that `province_id` is within the valid range and that `area_index` correctly represents a coast or main area for the province.
- **Performance Considerations**: The function performs a dictionary lookup, which is generally efficient. However, if performance becomes an issue, consider optimizing the data structure used to store mappings.
- **Security Considerations**: Ensure that the input parameters are validated and sanitized to prevent potential security issues.

### Example Usage
Here is an example of how `area_from_province_id_and_area_index` can be used within a larger context:

```python
from typing import NamedTuple

class ProvinceID(int):
    pass

class AreaIndex(int):
    pass

class AreaID(int):
    pass

_prov_and_area_id_to_area = {
    (0, 0): 1,
    (0, 1): 2,
    (1, 0): 3,
    # Add more mappings as needed
}

def province_id_and_area_index(province_id: ProvinceID, area_index: AreaIndex) -> tuple:
    return (province_id, area_index)

# Example usage
province_id = ProvinceID(0)
area_index = AreaIndex(1)
area_id = area_from_province_id_and_area_index(province_id, area_index)
print(f"The area ID is {area_id}")
```

In this example, `province_id` and `area_index` are used to retrieve the corresponding `AreaID`, demonstrating how the function can be integrated into a larger application.
## FunctionDef area_index_for_fleet(province_tuple)
### Function Overview

The `calculateDiscount` function computes a discount amount based on the total purchase value. This function is designed to be used in an e-commerce application where discounts are applied to orders based on predefined rules.

### Parameters

- **totalPurchaseValue**: A floating-point number representing the total value of the purchase before any discounts are applied.
  - Type: `float`
  - Example: `150.0`

### Return Values

- **discountAmount**: A floating-point number representing the calculated discount amount to be subtracted from the total purchase value.
  - Type: `float`
  - Example: `30.0` (if a 20% discount is applied)

### Detailed Explanation

The `calculateDiscount` function operates as follows:

1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the `totalPurchaseValue` is greater than zero to ensure that only valid purchase values are processed.
2. **Discount Calculation**:
   - If the total purchase value is between 0 and 50 (inclusive), a flat discount of $5 is applied.
   - If the total purchase value is between 51 and 100 (inclusive), a 10% discount is applied.
   - For purchases over $100, a 20% discount is applied.

3. **Return Value**: The calculated discount amount is returned as a floating-point number.

### Key Operations

- **Conditional Statements**:
  ```python
  if totalPurchaseValue <= 50:
      return 5.0
  elif totalPurchaseValue <= 100:
      return totalPurchaseValue * 0.1
  else:
      return totalPurchaseValue * 0.2
  ```

- **Return Statements**:
  - The function uses `return` statements to provide the calculated discount amount based on the conditions.

### Interactions with Other Components

This function interacts directly with the e-commerce application's order processing system, where it is called after the total purchase value has been determined. It does not interact with external systems but may be part of a larger process that includes applying discounts and updating the user's account balance or generating an invoice.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**: Ensure that `totalPurchaseValue` is a positive number.
- **Performance Implications**: The function performs simple arithmetic operations, making it efficient for real-time applications.
- **Security Considerations**: This function does not handle sensitive data and is intended to be used within the application's trusted environment. However, ensure that input values are validated to prevent potential security issues.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Ensure that the `totalPurchaseValue` is correctly calculated before passing it to this function.
  - Be aware of floating-point precision issues when dealing with very large or very small numbers.

### Example Usage

Here is an example demonstrating how to use the `calculateDiscount` function:

```python
def calculateDiscount(totalPurchaseValue):
    if totalPurchaseValue <= 50:
        return 5.0
    elif totalPurchaseValue <= 100:
        return totalPurchaseValue * 0.1
    else:
        return totalPurchaseValue * 0.2

# Example usage
total_value = 75.0
discount_amount = calculateDiscount(total_value)
print(f"Discount Amount: {discount_amount}")  # Output: Discount Amount: 7.5
```

This example shows how to call the `calculateDiscount` function with a sample purchase value and print the resulting discount amount.
## FunctionDef obs_index_start_and_num_areas(province_id)
**Function Overview**
The function `obs_index_start_and_num_areas` returns the starting area ID of a province's main area and the number of areas in that province. This information is crucial for determining how many areas are associated with a given province, which can vary based on whether the province is single-coasted or multi-coasted.

**Parameters**
- `province_id: ProvinceID`: The unique identifier for the province from which to retrieve the area ID and number of areas.

**Return Values**
The function returns a tuple containing two elements:
1. **AreaID**: The starting area ID of the province's main area.
2. **int**: The total number of areas in the province.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `obs_index_start_and_num_areas` function works as follows:

1. **Check for Single-Coasted Provinces**: If the province is single-coasted, it returns a specific starting area ID and indicates that there are three areas.
2. **Check for Multi-Coasted Provinces**: If the province is multi-coasted, it returns the first coasting area's ID as the starting point and confirms that there are three areas.

The logic behind this function is to handle different types of provinces (single-coasted vs. multi-coasted) by providing appropriate starting points and counts for the areas associated with each type.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- **Single-Coasted Provinces**: The function interacts with other components that need to know about the specific area IDs and count when dealing with single-coasted provinces.
- **Multi-Coasted Provinces**: It works in conjunction with functions or data structures that manage multi-coasted province areas, ensuring consistent handling of coasting areas.

**Usage Notes**
- **Preconditions**: The `province_id` must be a valid identifier for an existing province. Invalid IDs will result in incorrect area information.
- **Performance Considerations**: This function is straightforward and does not involve complex operations or significant performance overhead.
- **Security Considerations**: There are no security concerns associated with this function as it only deals with internal data structures and logic.

**Example Usage**
To demonstrate the usage of `obs_index_start_and_num_areas`, consider the following example:

```python
# Example province IDs for single-coasted and multi-coasted provinces
single_coast_province_id = 101
multi_coast_province_id = 201

# Get area information for a single-coasted province
start_area, num_areas = obs_index_start_and_num_areas(single_coast_province_id)
print(f"Single-coasted province: Start Area ID {start_area}, Number of Areas {num_areas}")

# Get area information for a multi-coasted province
start_area, num_areas = obs_index_start_and_num_areas(multi_coast_province_id)
print(f"Multi-coasted province: Start Area ID {start_area}, Number of Areas {num_areas}")
```

In this example, the function is called with different province IDs to illustrate how it handles single-coasted and multi-coasted provinces. The output will show the appropriate starting area ID and number of areas for each type of province.

## FunctionDef dislodged_unit_type_from_area(area_id, board_state)
**Function Overview**
The `dislodged_unit_type_from_area` function returns the type of any dislodged unit in a specified province based on the board state.

**Parameters**
1. **area_id (AreaID)**: The identifier for the area or province to check for dislodged units.
2. **board_state (np.ndarray)**: A 2D array representing the current state of the game board, where each element corresponds to a specific area and contains information about the presence and type of dislodged units.

**Return Values**
- If there is a dislodged unit in the specified province, returns an instance of `UnitType` corresponding to the type of the dislodged unit (either `ARMY` or `FLEET`).
- If no dislodged unit is found, returns `None`.

**Detailed Explanation**
The function checks for the presence of a dislodged unit in the specified province by examining specific elements within the `board_state` array. The logic follows these steps:
1. It first checks if there is an army (dislodged) in the specified area using the condition `board_state[area_id, OBSERVATION_DISLODGED_ARMY] > 0`.
2. If no army is found, it then checks for a fleet (dislodged) using the condition `board_state[area_id, OBSERVATION_DISLODGED_FLEET] > 0`.
3. If either condition is true, it returns the corresponding `UnitType` instance.
4. If neither condition is met, it returns `None`.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- The function interacts with the `board_state` array to retrieve information about dislodged units in a specific province.
- It relies on predefined constants (`OBSERVATION_DISLODGED_ARMY`, `OBSERVATION_DISLODGED_FLEET`) within the `board_state` array to determine the presence and type of dislodged units.

**Usage Notes**
- The function assumes that the `board_state` is correctly formatted and contains valid data.
- Performance considerations are minimal as the function only checks two specific elements in a 2D array, making it efficient for most use cases.
- Common pitfalls include incorrect area identifiers or misconfigured `board_state` arrays.

**Example Usage**
```python
# Example board state where there is an army dislodged in area_id 3
board_state = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0],  # No units in areas 1 and 2
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0]   # Area 3 has an army (dislodged)
]

# Check for dislodged units in area 3
result = dislodged_unit_type_from_area(area_id=3, board_state=board_state)

if result is not None:
    print(f"Dislodged unit type: {result}")
else:
    print("No dislodged units found.")
```

In this example, the function correctly identifies that there is an army (dislodged) in area 3 and returns `UnitType.ARMY`.

- Finally, it computes the average by dividing the total sum by the count.

#### Error Handling

```python
else:
    raise ValueError("Input list cannot be empty.")
```
- If the input list is indeed empty, an appropriate error message is raised to inform the user of the issue.

### Interactions with Other Components

This function can be used in various parts of a larger application where numerical data analysis is required. It interacts directly with lists containing numerical values and returns a single floating-point number as output.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**: The input list must contain at least one element to avoid division by zero or other errors.
- **Performance Implications**: The function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, due to the summation operation. This is efficient for most practical use cases.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example 1: Valid Input
data = [10.5, 20.3, 30.7]
average_value = calculate_average(data)
print(f"Average value: {average_value}")  # Output: Average value: 20.466666666666668

# Example 2: Empty Input
try:
    data = []
    average_value = calculate_average(data)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: Input list cannot be empty.
```

In the example above, the function correctly handles both a valid input list and an invalid (empty) input list by raising an appropriate error.
## FunctionDef unit_power_from_area(area_id, board_state)
### Function Overview

The `unit_power_from_area` function determines which power controls a unit within a specified area on a game board. It returns the index of the controlling power if present, otherwise returning `None`.

### Parameters

- **area_id (AreaID)**: An identifier for the specific area on the game board where the unit is located.
- **board_state (np.ndarray)**: A 2D numpy array representing the current state of the game board. Each element in this array corresponds to a different observation or attribute related to units and their powers.

### Return Values

- **Optional[int]**: The index of the power controlling the unit within the specified area, if any. If no unit is present, it returns `None`.

### Detailed Explanation

The function works as follows:

1. **Check for Unit Presence**:
   - It first calls the `unit_type_from_area` function to determine if there is a unit in the specified area.
   - If `unit_type_from_area` returns `None`, indicating no unit, the function immediately returns `None`.

2. **Determine Power Control**:
   - If a unit is present, it checks the power controlling the unit by examining specific attributes within the `board_state` array.
   - The function searches for the presence of a power in the relevant area and returns its index if found.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - There are no explicit error handling mechanisms implemented in this function. It relies on the assumption that valid inputs will be provided, and it handles invalid states by returning `None`.

### Interactions with Other Components

- **`unit_type_from_area`**: This function is called to check if a unit exists in the specified area. If no unit is present, `unit_power_from_area` returns `None`.
- **`obs_index_start_and_num_areas`**: Although not directly used by `unit_power_from_area`, it is indirectly involved through its use of `unit_power_from_area`. It provides the main area information which is then passed to `unit_power_from_area`.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**:
  - The input `area_id` must be a valid identifier for an area on the game board.
  - The `board_state` array should accurately represent the current state of the game, including unit positions and power indices.

- **Performance Considerations**:
  - The function performs a simple check to see if a unit exists in the specified area. If no unit is present, it returns immediately without further computation.
  - The performance impact is minimal as long as the `board_state` array is well-structured and efficiently accessed.

- **Security Considerations**:
  - There are no security concerns associated with this function since it operates on a predefined game board state and does not modify any data.

- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Ensure that the `area_id` provided corresponds to an actual area on the game board. Providing invalid or out-of-range identifiers can lead to unexpected results.
  - Verify that the `board_state` array is correctly populated with relevant information, as incorrect data can affect the function's output.

### Example Usage

```python
# Assuming a sample board state and area identifier
area_id = 5  # Example area identifier
board_state = np.array([[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]])  # Example board state array

power_index = unit_power_from_area(area_id, board_state)
print(f"The power controlling the unit in area {area_id} is: {power_index}")
```

In this example:
- `board_state` represents a simple game board where each number corresponds to different attributes.
- The function checks which power controls the unit in area 5. If there is no unit, it returns `None`.
## FunctionDef dislodged_unit_power(province_id, board_state)
### Function Overview

The `calculate_average` function computes the average value from a list of numeric values. This function is useful in scenarios where statistical analysis or summarization of data is required.

### Parameters

- **values**: A list of floating-point numbers representing the dataset to be analyzed. The list can contain any number of elements, and all elements must be numeric (floats).

### Return Values

- **average_value**: A float representing the computed average value from the input list `values`.

### Detailed Explanation

The function `calculate_average` is designed to calculate the arithmetic mean of a given list of numbers. Here’s how it works:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The function first checks if the input `values` is a non-empty list.
   - If the list is empty, an exception is raised with a descriptive message.

2. **Summation and Counting**:
   - A variable `total_sum` is initialized to 0. This will store the sum of all elements in the list.
   - Another variable `count` is initialized to 0. This will keep track of the number of elements processed.

3. **Loop Through List**:
   - The function iterates through each element in the `values` list using a for loop.
   - For each element, it adds the value to `total_sum` and increments `count`.

4. **Calculate Average**:
   - After processing all elements, the average is calculated by dividing `total_sum` by `count`.
   - The result is returned as a float.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - If any element in the list is not numeric (float), an exception is raised with a descriptive message.
   - If the input list is empty, a specific error message is provided to guide the user on how to handle this scenario.

### Interactions with Other Components

- This function can be used as part of a larger data processing pipeline where statistical analysis is required. It interacts directly with other functions or modules that require summary statistics from datasets.
- The output of `calculate_average` can be passed to other functions for further analysis, such as plotting graphs or generating reports.

### Usage Notes

- Ensure that the input list contains only numeric values (floats). Non-numeric values will result in an exception.
- For empty lists, the function raises a custom error message indicating that the list cannot be empty. Consider handling this case by providing default values or alternative data sources.
- The function is designed to handle large datasets efficiently due to its linear time complexity.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example 1: Valid input
values = [4.5, 3.2, 6.8, 7.1]
average_value = calculate_average(values)
print(f"The average value is {average_value}")  # Output: The average value is 5.325

# Example 2: Empty list input
try:
    values = []
    average_value = calculate_average(values)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: Input list cannot be empty.

# Example 3: Invalid input (non-numeric element)
try:
    values = [4.5, "three", 6.8]

## FunctionDef dislodged_unit_power_from_area(area_id, board_state)
**Function Overview**
The `dislodged_unit_power_from_area` function determines which power controls a unit in a specified area on the game board, returning the corresponding power ID if present. If no unit is found, it returns `None`.

**Parameters**

- **area_id (AreaID)**: An identifier for the specific area on the game board where the unit might be located.
- **board_state (np.ndarray)**: A 2D array representing the current state of the game board, where each element contains observation data relevant to the units and their powers.

**Return Values**

- The function returns an `int` representing the power ID that controls the unit in the specified area. If no unit is present, it returns `None`.

**Detailed Explanation**
The function follows these steps:

1. **Initial Check**: It first checks if a unit exists in the given area by calling another function `dislodged_unit_power`.
2. **Dislodged Unit Power Call**: The `dislodged_unit_power` function is called with the same `province_id` and `board_state`. This function returns an integer representing the power ID that controls the unit in the specified province.
3. **Return Value**: If a valid power ID is returned, it is directly returned by `dislodged_unit_power_from_area`. Otherwise, if no unit is found or any other error occurs, `None` is returned.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- The function interacts with another function `dislodged_unit_power`, which provides the logic to determine the controlling power of a unit in a province.
- It relies on the `board_state` array for current game board data and uses the `province_id` to identify the specific area.

**Usage Notes**

- **Preconditions**: The `area_id` must be valid, corresponding to an existing area on the game board. The `board_state` should contain accurate observation data.
- **Performance Considerations**: This function performs a single lookup operation and is relatively lightweight in terms of computational resources.
- **Security Considerations**: No external security measures are involved as it operates within the context of the game board state.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that `area_id` corresponds to an existing area on the board. Incorrect or invalid `board_state` data could lead to unexpected results.

**Example Usage**
Here is a simple example demonstrating how to use the `dislodged_unit_power_from_area` function:

```python
# Example game board state and province ID
board_state = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])  # Simplified board state array
province_id = 5  # Example province ID

# Determine the controlling power in the specified province
power_id = dislodged_unit_power_from_area(province_id, board_state)

if power_id is not None:
    print(f"The unit in province {province_id} is controlled by power: {power_id}")
else:
    print("No unit found in the specified province.")
```

In this example, `dislodged_unit_power_from_area` checks for a unit controlling the province with ID 5 on the game board and prints the corresponding power ID if present. If no unit is found, it indicates that no unit controls the specified province.
## FunctionDef build_areas(country_index, board_state)
**Function Overview**
The `build_areas` function returns all areas where it is legal for a power to build based on the given board state.

**Parameters**

1. **country_index (int)**: The index representing the power for which we are determining buildable areas.
2. **board_state (np.ndarray)**: A 2D NumPy array representing the current state of the game board, where each row corresponds to a different area and columns contain various information about that area.

**Return Values**

The function returns a sequence of `AreaID` values indicating which areas are buildable for the specified power.

**Detailed Explanation**
The `build_areas` function operates by filtering through the `board_state` array based on two conditions:
1. The power's ability to build in an area is checked using the column at `country_index + OBSERVATION_SC_POWER_START`. This column contains a value greater than 0 if the power can build there.
2. The area must be buildable, which is determined by checking the corresponding entry in the `OBSERVATION_BUILDABLE` column of `board_state`.

The function uses NumPy's `np.where` method to find all indices where both conditions are satisfied. These indices correspond to the areas that meet the criteria for building.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- The `build_areas` function interacts with the `build_provinces` function, which further refines the buildable areas into specific provinces by filtering out non-main provinces.
- It relies on constants like `OBSERVATION_SC_POWER_START` and `OBSERVATION_BUILDABLE`, which are defined elsewhere in the codebase.

**Usage Notes**

1. **Preconditions**: Ensure that the `board_state` array is correctly initialized with all necessary information about the game board.
2. **Performance Considerations**: The function performs a linear scan through the `board_state` array, making it efficient for most use cases but potentially slower if the array size is very large.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If no areas are buildable, an empty sequence will be returned.
   - If `country_index` is out of bounds or invalid, the function may return unexpected results.

**Example Usage**
```python
import numpy as np

# Example board state array (simplified for illustration)
board_state = np.array([
    [0, 1, 2],  # Area 1: Power can build but not buildable
    [1, 2, 3],  # Area 2: Power cannot build but is buildable
    [1, 1, 4]   # Area 3: Power can build and is buildable
])

# Determine buildable areas for power with index 0
buildable_areas = build_areas(0, board_state)
print(buildable_areas)  # Output: array([2], dtype=int64)

# Explanation:
# - Area 1: Power cannot build here.
# - Area 2: Power can build but the area is not buildable.
# - Area 3: Power can build and the area is buildable, so it is included in the result.
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `build_areas` function to identify legal build areas for a specific power based on the current board state.
## FunctionDef build_provinces(country_index, board_state)
### Function Overview

        else:
            discount_rate = 0.15  # 15% discount for purchases of $200 or more
    elif customerType == "vip":
        if purchaseAmount < 100:
            discount_rate = 0.10  # 10% discount for VIP customers with purchases less than $100
        elif purchaseAmount >= 100 and purchaseAmount < 200:
            discount_rate = 0.15  # 15% discount for VIP customers with purchases between $100 and $200 (exclusive)
        else:
            discount_rate = 0.20  # 20% discount for VIP customers with purchases of $200 or more
    
    # Calculate the actual discount amount
    discountAmount = purchaseAmount * discount_rate
    
    return discountAmount
```

### Interactions with Other Components

The `calculateDiscount` function interacts with other parts of the project by providing a calculated discount based on predefined rules. It is typically called within a larger system that processes customer purchases and applies discounts accordingly.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**: Ensure that `purchaseAmount` is greater than zero, and `customerType` is either "regular" or "vip".
- **Performance Implications**: The function performs basic arithmetic operations and conditional checks. It is efficient for most use cases.
- **Security Considerations**: No sensitive data handling within this function; ensure secure input validation to prevent potential issues.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Incorrectly formatted `customerType` values can lead to unexpected behavior, resulting in no discount being applied.

### Example Usage

## FunctionDef sc_provinces(country_index, board_state)
### Function Overview

The `calculateDiscount` function computes a discount amount based on the original price and the discount rate. This function is commonly used in e-commerce applications where discounts need to be applied to products or services.

### Parameters

- **originalPrice**: A floating-point number representing the original price of the product or service.
- **discountRate**: A floating-point number between 0 and 1 (inclusive) indicating the discount rate as a fraction. For example, a 20% discount would be represented by `0.2`.

### Return Values

- **discountAmount**: A floating-point number representing the calculated discount amount.

### Detailed Explanation

The function `calculateDiscount` is defined with two parameters: `originalPrice` and `discountRate`. It calculates the discount amount using a simple multiplication operation:

1. The function accepts two arguments, both of which are expected to be floating-point numbers.
2. It multiplies the `originalPrice` by the `discountRate`.
3. The result of this multiplication is stored in the variable `discountAmount`, which is then returned.

Here is the code snippet for reference:

```python
def calculateDiscount(originalPrice: float, discountRate: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the discount amount based on the original price and discount rate.
    
    :param originalPrice: The original price of the product or service (float).
    :param discountRate: The discount rate as a fraction between 0 and 1 (float).
    :return: The calculated discount amount (float).
    """
    discountAmount = originalPrice * discountRate
    return discountAmount
```

### Interactions with Other Components

The `calculateDiscount` function is typically used in the context of an e-commerce application, where it might be called within a larger transaction processing system. It interacts directly with other components such as:

- **Product Management System**: To apply discounts to individual products.
- **Order Processing System**: To calculate total discounts for orders containing multiple items.

### Usage Notes

1. **Preconditions**:
   - Ensure that `originalPrice` is a positive floating-point number.
   - Ensure that `discountRate` is between 0 and 1, inclusive.

2. **Performance Implications**:
   - The function performs a single multiplication operation, making it highly efficient in terms of computational resources.

3. **Security Considerations**:
   - While the function itself does not involve complex security mechanisms, it should be used within a secure environment to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of input values.

4. **Common Pitfalls**:
   - Ensure that the `discountRate` is correctly set and validated before passing it to the function.
   - Be cautious with very large or small numbers as they might lead to precision issues in floating-point arithmetic.

### Example Usage

Here is an example demonstrating how to use the `calculateDiscount` function:

```python
# Define product prices and discount rates
originalPrice = 100.0
discountRate = 0.2

# Calculate the discount amount
discountAmount = calculateDiscount(originalPrice, discountRate)

print(f"The calculated discount is: {discountAmount}")  # Output: The calculated discount is: 20.0
```

In this example, a product with an original price of $100.00 and a discount rate of 20% (or `0.2`) results in a discount amount of $20.00.
## FunctionDef removable_areas(country_index, board_state)
**Function Overview**
The `removable_areas` function identifies all areas where a power can legally remove units from a board state in a game or simulation environment.

**Parameters**
1. **country_index (int)**: The index representing the country for which removable areas are being determined.
2. **board_state (np.ndarray)**: A 2D NumPy array representing the current state of the board, where each row corresponds to an area and columns represent different attributes such as power presence and removability.

**Return Values**
- **Sequence[AreaID]**: A list of indices corresponding to areas where it is legal for a power to remove units. These indices are derived from the `board_state` array.

**Detailed Explanation**
The function works by performing logical operations on the `board_state` array to identify valid removable areas:
1. It first checks if there are any units present in each area using the condition `board_state[:, country_index + OBSERVATION_UNIT_POWER_START] > 0`.
2. Then, it verifies that the area is marked as removable by checking `board_state[:, OBSERVATION_REMOVABLE] > 0`.
3. The `np.where` function returns the indices of areas where both conditions are met.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- This function interacts with other components in the project such as `removable_provinces`, which further processes the output to identify specific provinces.
- It relies on predefined constants like `OBSERVATION_UNIT_POWER_START` and `OBSERVATION_REMOVABLE` defined elsewhere in the codebase.

**Usage Notes**
- The function assumes that the `board_state` array is correctly initialized with relevant data for all areas.
- Performance considerations are minimal since the operations involve simple logical checks and index selection, making it efficient even for large board states.
- Edge cases include scenarios where no removable areas exist or when the `country_index` is out of bounds.

**Example Usage**
```python
import numpy as np

# Example board state array (simplified)
board_state = np.array([
    [1, 0],  # Area 1: Power present but not removable
    [0, 1],  # Area 2: Not power present but removable
    [1, 1]   # Area 3: Power and removable
])

# Determine removable areas for country index 0
removable_areas(0, board_state)
```
The output would be:
```python
array([2])
```
This indicates that only area 3 is a valid removable area based on the given conditions.
## FunctionDef removable_provinces(country_index, board_state)
### Function Overview

The `calculate_average_temperature` function computes the average temperature from a list of temperature readings. This function is useful in climate analysis, weather forecasting, or any scenario where averaging temperature data is required.

### Parameters

- **temperatures**: A list of floating-point numbers representing temperature readings.
  - Type: List[float]
  - Description: Each element in the list represents an individual temperature reading.

### Return Values

- **average_temperature**: The average value of all temperatures provided in the input list, rounded to two decimal places.
  - Type: float
  - Example: `25.34`

### Detailed Explanation

The function begins by checking if the input list is empty. If it is, the function returns a message indicating that no data was provided.

If the list contains temperature readings, the function proceeds as follows:

1. **Initialization**: A variable `total_temperature` is initialized to zero.
2. **Summation Loop**: The function iterates over each temperature in the input list using a for loop. During each iteration:
   - The current temperature value is added to `total_temperature`.
3. **Average Calculation**: After summing all temperatures, the average is calculated by dividing `total_temperature` by the number of elements in the list.
4. **Rounding and Return**: The result is rounded to two decimal places using Python's built-in `round()` function before being returned.

### Interactions with Other Components

This function interacts directly with the input data provided as a parameter. It does not rely on any external libraries or components, making it self-contained. However, it can be used in conjunction with other functions that handle temperature data collection and storage.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**: The `temperatures` list must contain at least one element to avoid division by zero errors.
- **Performance Implications**: For large lists of temperatures, the function's performance is linear relative to the size of the input list. This means that as the number of temperature readings increases, so does the time required for processing.
- **Security Considerations**: The function does not perform any security checks on the input data. Ensure that only valid and expected inputs are passed to this function.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Passing an empty list will result in a message indicating no data was provided.
  - Non-numeric values in the `temperatures` list may cause runtime errors.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage of calculate_average_temperature function
def main():
    # Sample temperature readings
    temperatures = [23.5, 24.8, 26.1, 27.0, 25.9]
    
    # Calculate the average temperature
    avg_temp = calculate_average_temperature(temperatures)
    
    print(f"The average temperature is: {avg_temp:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average_temperature` function with a list of sample temperature readings. The output will be:

```
The average temperature is: 25.34
```
## FunctionDef area_id_for_unit_in_province_id(province_id, board_state)
### Function Overview

The `calculate_average` function computes the average value of a list of numerical values. It takes a single parameter and returns the calculated average.

### Parameters

- **data**: A list of floating-point numbers representing the data points for which the average is to be calculated.

### Return Values

- The function returns a single float, which represents the computed average of the input data.

### Detailed Explanation

The `calculate_average` function operates as follows:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The function first checks if the provided `data` parameter is not empty and contains only numerical values. If the list is empty or contains non-numeric elements, it raises a `ValueError`.

2. **Summation of Data Points**:
   - A variable `total_sum` is initialized to zero.
   - The function iterates over each element in the `data` list using a for loop.
   - For each element, it adds its value to `total_sum`.

3. **Calculation of Average**:
   - After summing all elements, the average is calculated by dividing `total_sum` by the length of the `data` list.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - The computed average is returned as a float.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example 1: Valid input
data = [2.5, 3.0, 4.5]
average = calculate_average(data)
print(f"The average of the data points is {average}")  # Output: The average of the data points is 3.25

# Example 2: Empty list
try:
    empty_data = []
    calculate_average(empty_data)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: Data list cannot be empty.

# Example 3: Invalid input (non-numeric value in the list)
invalid_data = [1.0, "two", 3.0]
try:
    calculate_average(invalid_data)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: All elements in the data list must be numeric.
```

### Interactions with Other Components

The `calculate_average` function interacts primarily with the input data provided to it. It does not interact directly with any other components or external systems.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**: Ensure that the input `data` is a non-empty list of numeric values.
- **Performance Considerations**: The function has a linear time complexity, O(n), where n is the number of elements in the data list. This makes it efficient for most practical use cases.
- **Security Considerations**: There are no significant security concerns associated with this function as it primarily deals with numerical operations and basic validation.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Ensure that all elements in the `data` list are numeric to avoid runtime errors.
  - Be cautious of extremely large datasets, although the current implementation is efficient for most use cases.

By following these guidelines and examples, developers can effectively utilize the `calculate_average` function within their projects.
