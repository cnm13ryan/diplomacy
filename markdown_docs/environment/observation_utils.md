## ClassDef Season
**Season**: The function of Season is to represent different seasons in the context of the board game Diplomacy, each associated with specific actions players can perform during that season.

**attributes**: This class does not have any parameters or external attributes; it uses Python's built-in `enum.Enum` for defining its instances.
· SPRING_MOVES: Represents the season when moves are allowed in the game.
· SPRING_RETREATS: Represents the season when retreats are possible after initial moves.
· AUTUMN_MOVES: Represents the autumn season where additional moves can be made.
· AUTUMN_RETREATS: Represents the season for performing retreats after autumn moves.
· BUILDS: Represents the season when players can perform builds, such as constructing units.

**Code Description**: The `Season` class is an enumeration that represents different seasons in the game of Diplomacy. Each instance corresponds to a specific phase during which certain actions are allowed. 

- **SPRING_MOVES and SPRING_RETREATS**: These two constants represent the spring season, where players can make moves and retreats after their initial moves.
- **AUTUMN_MOVES and AUTUMN_RETREATS**: These constants denote the autumn season, allowing for additional moves and retreats following the spring actions.
- **BUILDS**: This constant signifies the build phase during which players are allowed to construct new units.

The class provides several methods:
- `is_moves()`: Returns True if the current season is either SPRING_MOVES or AUTUMN_MOVES, indicating that move actions can be performed.
- `is_retreats()`: Returns True if the current season is either SPRING_RETREATS or AUTUMN_RETREATS, indicating that retreat actions are allowed.
- `is_builds()`: Returns True if the current season is BUILDS, signifying that players can perform builds.

These methods facilitate checking the current game state to determine what actions are permissible during each phase of the game.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that you import it correctly and use its instances appropriately within your game logic. For example:
```python
from observation_utils.Season import Season

def check_current_action(current_season):
    if current_season.is_moves():
        print("Current season allows moves.")
    elif current_season.is_retreats():
        print("Current season allows retreats.")
    elif current_season.is_builds():
        print("Current season is for builds.")
```

**Output Example**: If `current_season` is set to `Season.AUTUMN_MOVES`, the output of the function would be:
"Current season allows moves."
### FunctionDef is_moves(self)
**is_moves**: The function of is_moves is to check if the current season instance represents either SPRING_MOVES or AUTUMN_MOVES.
**parameters**: 
· self: A reference to the current instance of the Season class.

**Code Description**: 
The `is_moves` method in the `Season` class checks whether the current instance of the season corresponds to either SPRING_MOVES or AUTUMN_MOVES. It does this by comparing the current instance with two predefined constants, `Season.SPRING_MOVES` and `Season.AUTUMN_MOVES`. If the current instance matches either constant, the method returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

This function is useful for scenarios where you need to determine if a specific season represents moves or actions. For example, in an environment simulation or game development context, different seasons might have unique behaviors or events associated with them.

**Note**: Ensure that the constants `Season.SPRING_MOVES` and `Season.AUTUMN_MOVES` are properly defined within the `Season` class for this method to work correctly. The method assumes that these constants are valid season instances representing SPRING_MOVES and AUTUMN_MOVES, respectively.

**Output Example**: 
If the current instance of `Season` is set to `Season.SPRING_MOVES`, then calling `is_moves()` will return `True`. Similarly, if the current instance is set to `Season.AUTUMN_MOVES`, it will also return `True`. For any other season instances (like `Season.SUMMER` or `Season.WINTER`), the method will return `False`.

Example usage:
```python
# Assuming Season class and constants are properly defined
current_season = Season.SPRING_MOVES
print(current_season.is_moves())  # Output: True

another_season = Season.WINTER
print(another_season.is_moves())  # Output: False
```
***
### FunctionDef is_retreats(self)
**is_retreats**: The function of is_retreats is to determine if the current season instance represents either SPRING_RETREATS or AUTUMN_RETREATS.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `is_retreats` method checks whether the current instance of the `Season` class matches one of two specific instances: `SPRING_RETREATS` or `AUTUMN_RETREATS`. It returns a boolean value (`True` if the condition is met, and `False` otherwise). This function is useful for identifying seasonal retreats within the context of the application.

Here's a detailed analysis of the code:
- The method uses an `if` statement to compare the current instance with two specific season constants: `Season.SPRING_RETREATS` and `Season.AUTUMN_RETREATS`.
- If the current instance is equal to either constant, the function returns `True`, indicating that it represents a retreat season.
- Otherwise, if neither condition is met, the method returns `False`.

**Note**: Ensure that the constants `SPRING_RETREATS` and `AUTUMN_RETREATS` are properly defined within the `Season` class for this function to work correctly. Additionally, verify that the comparison is case-sensitive unless explicitly handled.

**Output Example**: 
- If an instance of `Season` is created with a value representing SPRING_RETREATS, calling `.is_retreats()` on it will return `True`.
- Similarly, if an instance represents AUTUMN_RETREATS, the same method call will also return `True`.
- For any other season, such as `SEASON_SUMMER`, the function will return `False`.
***
### FunctionDef is_builds(self)
**is_builds**: The function of is_builds is to check if the current season instance matches the BUILDS constant.

**parameters**:
· self: The reference to the current instance of the Season class.

**Code Description**: 
The `is_builds` method serves as a utility for determining whether the current season object represents the "BUILDS" state. It compares the current instance (`self`) with the `Season.BUILDS` constant and returns a boolean value indicating equality. This functionality is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to perform actions based on the specific season being "BUILDS".

For example, within a larger system that manages different seasons for various activities or events, this method can be used to execute certain logic when the current season is determined to be "BUILDS".

**Note**: Ensure that `Season.BUILDS` is properly defined and accessible within the class. The comparison relies on the correct implementation of the `__eq__` method in the Season class if more complex comparisons are needed.

**Output Example**: 
If the current instance represents the "BUILDS" season, then `is_builds()` will return `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. For example:
```python
# Assuming that s is an instance of Season and BUILDS is a valid constant
if s.is_builds():
    print("The current season is BUILDS.")
else:
    print("The current season is not BUILDS.")
```
This will output "The current season is BUILDS." if `s` matches the `Season.BUILDS` constant.
***
## ClassDef UnitType
**UnitType**: The function of UnitType is to define the types of units that can be present on an area in the game.
**attributes**: 
· ARMY: Represents an army unit with a value of 0.
· FLEET: Represents a fleet unit with a value of 1.

**Code Description**: The `UnitType` class is defined as an enumeration (enum) with two members, `ARMY` and `Fleet`. This class serves as a way to categorize the types of units that can be present on areas in the game. Each member corresponds to a specific unit type: `ARMY` for land-based units and `FLEET` for sea-based units.

The use of an enum ensures that only valid values can be assigned, which helps maintain consistency throughout the codebase. This class is referenced by other functions within the project such as `unit_type`, `dislodged_unit_type`, and `unit_type_from_area`. These functions rely on `UnitType` to determine the type of unit present in a given province or area.

In more detail, the `moves_phase_areas` function utilizes `UnitType` to filter out areas based on the unit types. Specifically, it checks whether a unit is a fleet and if it's the first area of its province and the province is bicoastal, then it excludes that area from consideration. This ensures that only relevant areas are included in the final list of active units for the current phase.

The `unit_type` function uses `UnitType` to determine the type of unit present in a given province by checking the board state. Similarly, the `dislodged_unit_type` and related functions use `UnitType` to identify any dislodged units in a province based on their type.

**Note**: Ensure that when using `UnitType`, you import it from its module (`observation_utils.py`) as it is not part of Python's standard library. This class should be used consistently across the project to avoid confusion and ensure accurate unit classification.
## ClassDef ProvinceType
**ProvinceType**: The function of ProvinceType is to define different types of provinces based on their geographical characteristics.

**attributes**: 
· LAND: Represents inland provinces.
· SEA: Represents sea provinces.
· COASTAL: Represents coastal provinces.
· BICOASTAL: Represents bicoastal provinces, which are both coastal and have a significant sea area.

**Code Description**: The ProvinceType class is an enumeration (enum) in Python that categorizes provinces into different types based on their geographical features. This classification helps in understanding the characteristics of each province for various applications such as game development, geographic information systems, or simulation models.

The `ProvinceType` enum includes four distinct values:
- **LAND**: Represents inland regions with no direct sea access.
- **SEA**: Denotes areas that are entirely covered by water and do not have any land borders.
- **COASTAL**: Refers to provinces that have a coastline but also contain significant inland areas.
- **BICOASTAL**: Indicates provinces that are both coastal and have extensive sea areas, often implying strategic importance.

This classification is crucial for determining the behavior of entities in certain applications. For example, in a game environment, different types of provinces might have varying movement costs or resource availability based on their type.

The `province_type_from_id` function, which calls this enum, maps province IDs to corresponding `ProvinceType` values. This function helps in identifying the geographical characteristics of a province given its ID, enabling further processing and decision-making within the application.

In the context of the project, the `area_index_for_fleet` function uses the `province_type_from_id` function to determine the area index for fleets based on their location. If the province is bicoastal, it adjusts the index by adding one; otherwise, it sets the index to zero. This functionality ensures that fleet operations are correctly managed according to the geographical type of the province.

**Note**: When using this code, ensure that you handle all possible `ProvinceID` values appropriately to avoid runtime errors. The `province_type_from_id` function raises a `ValueError` for invalid IDs, so it's important to validate input before calling this function.
## FunctionDef province_type_from_id(province_id)
**province_type_from_id**: The function of province_type_from_id is to map a given province ID to its corresponding geographical type.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: province_id (ProvinceID)
   - A numerical identifier representing a specific province within the system.

**Code Description**: This function determines the type of a province based on its ID. It uses a series of conditional checks to categorize the province into one of four types: LAND, SEA, COASTAL, or BICOASTAL. The categorization is based on the value range of the `province_id`:

- If `province_id < 14`, the province type is set to LAND.
- If `14 <= province_id < 33`, the province type is set to SEA.
- If `33 <= province_id < 72`, the province type is set to COASTAL.
- If `72 <= province_id < 75`, the province type is set to BICOASTAL.

For any `province_id` greater than or equal to 75, a `ValueError` is raised because it indicates an invalid ID. This function serves as a crucial utility for identifying the geographical characteristics of provinces in various applications such as game development, geographic information systems, and simulation models.

**Note**: Ensure that all possible `ProvinceID` values are validated before calling this function to avoid runtime errors. The function raises a `ValueError` for invalid IDs to help catch potential issues early.

**Output Example**: If the input `province_id` is 20, the output would be `ProvinceType.COASTAL`. If the input `province_id` is 74, the output would also be `ProvinceType.BICOASTAL`. For an invalid `province_id` like 80, the function will raise a `ValueError`.

This function is called by the `area_index_for_fleet` function to determine the area index for fleets based on their location. Specifically, if the province type determined by `province_type_from_id` is BICOASTAL, it adjusts the area index by adding one; otherwise, it sets the index to zero. This functionality ensures that fleet operations are correctly managed according to the geographical type of the province.
## FunctionDef province_id_and_area_index(area)
**province_id_and_area_index**: The function of province_id_and_area_index is to determine the province ID and area index within that province based on an area ID.
· parameter1: area (AreaID) - The ID of the area in the observation vector, an integer from 0 to 80.
· parameter2: None

**Code Description**: This function takes an area ID as input and returns a tuple containing the province ID and the area index within that province. It handles both single-coasted provinces (where there is only one main area) and bicoastal provinces (which have two coastal areas).

The function first checks if the given area ID falls within the range of single-coasted provinces. If it does, it returns the area ID as the province ID and 0 as the area index.

For other area IDs, the function calculates the province ID by adjusting for the number of single-coasted provinces (SINGLE_COASTED_PROVINCES) and then dividing the remaining area ID by 3 to determine which coastal area within a bicoastal province it corresponds to. The remainder when divided by 3 gives the specific coastal area index.

This function is crucial in various operations involving areas, such as determining moveable units, supply centres, and buildable provinces. For example, in `moves_phase_areas`, this function helps identify which main area of a province has active units for movement purposes. Similarly, in `order_relevant_areas`, it ensures that only the primary area (not coastal areas) of each province is considered when sorting move orders.

**Note**: Ensure that the input area ID is within the valid range (0 to 80). The function assumes that the area IDs are correctly mapped to provinces and their respective main or coastal areas. Incorrect mapping can lead to incorrect province or area index determination.

**Output Example**: If the input area ID is 25, which falls outside the single-coasted provinces, the function might return (34, 1), where 34 is the province ID for a bicoastal province and 1 indicates the second coastal area.
## FunctionDef area_from_province_id_and_area_index(province_id, area_index)
**area_from_province_id_and_area_index**: The function of `area_from_province_id_and_area_index` is to convert a province ID and an area index into an area ID.

**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `province_id`: This is an integer between 0 and `SINGLE_COASTED_PROVINCES + BICOASTAL_PROVINCES - 1`, representing the unique identifier of a province.
· parameter2: `area_index`: An integer that is either 0 for the main area of a province, or 1 or 2 for the coast in bicoastal provinces.

**Code Description**: 
The function `area_from_province_id_and_area_index` serves as the inverse operation to `province_id_and_area_index`. Given a specific province ID and an area index within that province, it returns the corresponding area ID. The mapping is stored internally in `_prov_and_area_id_to_area`, which is likely a dictionary or similar data structure holding the province-area pairs.

The function checks for the validity of the inputs by ensuring `province_id` falls within its expected range. If invalid values are provided, a `KeyError` exception will be raised. For bicoastal provinces (where `obs_index_start_and_num_areas(province_id)[1] == 3`), it handles the case where the unit type is a fleet and returns either the first or second coast area ID based on whether the first coast contains a valid unit.

This function interacts with other functions such as `area_id_for_unit_in_province_id`, which uses `area_from_province_id_and_area_index` to determine the correct area ID for units in specific provinces. The relationship between these functions highlights how they collectively manage and retrieve data related to areas within provinces, ensuring that the correct area is identified based on the province's characteristics.

**Note**: Ensure that the input values for `province_id` and `area_index` are valid before calling this function to avoid runtime errors. Pay special attention to handling bicoastal provinces correctly as specified in the docstring.

**Output Example**: The output of the function is an `AreaID`, which could be a numerical identifier representing the area within the province, such as 3 for the main land area or 4 for one of the coast areas in a bicoastal province.
## FunctionDef area_index_for_fleet(province_tuple)
**area_index_for_fleet**: The function of area_index_for_fleet is to determine the appropriate area index for fleets based on their location within a province.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: province_tuple (ProvinceWithFlag)
   - A tuple containing two elements: the first element is a `province_id` that identifies the specific province, and the second element is an identifier or flag related to the province's characteristics.

**Code Description**: The function `area_index_for_fleet` takes a single parameter, `province_tuple`, which is expected to be a tuple where the first element is a `province_id` and the second element can be any type of flag. It uses the `province_type_from_id` function to determine the geographical type of the province based on its ID.

1. The function first calls `province_type_from_id(province_tuple[0])`, which returns the corresponding `ProvinceType` for the given `province_id`.
2. If the returned `ProvinceType` is `BICOASTAL`, the function increments the area index by 1, returning `province_tuple[1] + 1`.
3. Otherwise, if the province type is not BICOASTAL, it returns 0.

This functionality ensures that fleet operations are correctly managed based on the geographical characteristics of the province. Specifically, a higher area index for bicoastal provinces might indicate more complex or resource-intensive operations compared to non-bicoastal provinces.

**Note**: Ensure that `province_tuple` is always provided with the correct structure (a tuple containing a `province_id` and an additional flag). The `province_type_from_id` function raises a `ValueError` for invalid `province_id` values, so it's important to validate input before calling this function.

**Output Example**: If `province_tuple` is `(74, 5)`, the output would be `6`. This is because province ID 74 corresponds to a BICOASTAL province, and the area index is incremented by 1. If `province_tuple` is `(20, 3)`, the output would be `3`, as province ID 20 corresponds to a COASTAL province, and no increment is applied.
## FunctionDef obs_index_start_and_num_areas(province_id)
**obs_index_start_and_num_areas**: The function of obs_index_start_and_num_areas is to return the area_id of the province's main area and the number of areas within that province.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: province_id (ProvinceID) - The id of the province.

**Code Description**: This function calculates the starting area ID for a given province and determines the total number of areas in that province. It handles two cases:
- If the province is one of the single-coasted provinces, it returns the province's own ID as the main area ID and 1 as the number of areas.
- For other provinces, it calculates the starting area ID by adding a fixed offset to an adjusted province index and always returns 3 as the number of areas.

The function plays a crucial role in determining how many areas are associated with each province, which is essential for various operations such as managing units within provinces during game phases. This information is used by other functions like `moves_phase_areas`, where it helps filter out valid move areas based on unit types and dislodged status.

**Note**: Ensure that the input `province_id` is correctly mapped to a province in your system, as incorrect values can lead to misinterpretation of area IDs. Additionally, the function assumes that each province has exactly 3 areas unless it's one of the single-coasted provinces, which might not always be true depending on the game or scenario configuration.

**Output Example**: If `province_id` is 2 and it's not a single-coasted province:
- The function will return `(5, 3)`, where 5 is the starting area ID for this province, and 3 indicates that there are three areas in total.

## FunctionDef unit_type_from_area(area_id, board_state)
**unit_type_from_area**: The function of unit_type_from_area is to determine the type of unit present at a specific area on the game board.
**parameters**:
· area_id: AreaID - Represents the ID of the area where the unit is located.
· board_state: np.ndarray - A 2D array representing the current state of the game board, where each element contains observation data for different areas and units.

**Code Description**: The function `unit_type_from_area` checks the given `board_state` to determine the type of unit present in the specified `area_id`. It does this by examining specific indices within the `board_state` array. If a non-zero value is found at the index corresponding to `OBSERVATION_UNIT_ARMY`, it returns `UnitType.ARMY`. Similarly, if a non-zero value is found at the index for `OBSERVATION_UNIT_FLEET`, it returns `UnitType.FLEET`. If neither condition is met, the function returns `None`.

This function is called by other functions within the project such as `unit_type` and `dislodged_unit_power_from_area`. For instance, `unit_type` relies on `unit_type_from_area` to determine if a unit exists in a given province before proceeding with further checks. Similarly, `dislodged_unit_power_from_area` uses `unit_type_from_area` to validate the presence of a dislodged unit and then determines its power.

The function ensures that only valid units are identified based on their type, which is crucial for maintaining consistency throughout the game logic. It leverages the `UnitType` enum defined in the same module to categorize different types of units accurately.

**Note**: Ensure you import the necessary modules and enums from `observation_utils.py`. Specifically, use `from observation_utils.py import UnitType`.

**Output Example**: If there is an army unit present at the specified area, the function will return `UnitType.ARMY`. For example:
```python
unit_type = unit_type_from_area(area_id=10, board_state=np.array([[0, 0, 2], [0, 3, 0]]))
print(unit_type)  # Output: UnitType.ARMY

unit_type = unit_type_from_area(area_id=5, board_state=np.array([[0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0]]))
print(unit_type)  # Output: UnitType.FLEET
```
If no valid unit is found at the specified area, the function will return `None`. For example:
```python
unit_type = unit_type_from_area(area_id=7, board_state=np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]))
print(unit_type)  # Output: None
```

## FunctionDef dislodged_unit_type_from_area(area_id, board_state)
**dislodged_unit_type_from_area**: The function of dislodged_unit_type_from_area is to determine the type of any dislodged unit present in a specific area.

**parameters**:
· `area_id`: An instance of `AreaID` representing the unique identifier of the area being checked.
· `board_state`: A NumPy array (`np.ndarray`) that represents the current state of the game board, where each element corresponds to an observation about the area or province.

**Code Description**: The function `dislodged_unit_type_from_area` checks if there are any dislodged units in a given area by examining specific elements within the `board_state`. It returns the type of the first dislodged unit it finds, or `None` if no such unit exists. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. The function starts by checking if the value at `board_state[area_id, OBSERVATION_DISLODGED_ARMY]` is greater than 0. If true, it means an army unit has been dislodged in this area.
2. If no army unit is found, the function then checks if the value at `board_state[area_id, OBSERVATION_DISLODGED_FLEET]` is greater than 0. If true, a fleet unit has been dislodged.
3. If neither condition is met (i.e., both values are 0), it means no dislodged units exist in the area, and the function returns `None`.

This function is called by another function named `dislodged_unit_type` within the same module (`observation_utils.py`). The `dislodged_unit_type` function takes a province ID instead of an area ID and calls `dislodged_unit_type_from_area` to get the type of dislodged unit in the main area of the province. 

The use of `UnitType` from the `UnitType` enum ensures that only valid types are returned, maintaining consistency across the codebase.

**Note**: Ensure you import `AreaID`, `np.ndarray`, and `UnitType` appropriately before using this function. The `dislodged_unit_type_from_area` function is part of a suite of functions designed to handle dislodged units in various areas or provinces within the game, ensuring that the correct unit types are identified.

**Output Example**: If there is an army unit dislodged in the specified area, the function might return `UnitType.ARMY`. If no dislodged units exist, it will return `None`. For example:
```
result = dislodged_unit_type_from_area(AreaID(123), board_state)
# result could be UnitType.ARMY or None
```
## FunctionDef unit_power(province_id, board_state)
**unit_power**: The function of unit_power is to return which power controls the unit province (None if no unit there).
· parameter1: province_id (ProvinceID) - The ID of the province whose controlling power needs to be determined.
· parameter2: board_state (np.ndarray) - A 2D array representing the current state of the game board, containing observation data for different areas and units.

**Code Description**: This function calculates which power controls a unit in a specific province by first determining the main area's ID and then using that information to identify the controlling power. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Obtain Main Area Information**:
   - The function calls `obs_index_start_and_num_areas(province_id)` to get the starting area ID (`main_area`) of the given province and other relevant details.
   
2. **Identify Controlling Power**:
   - With the main area ID obtained, the function then uses this information in conjunction with the `unit_power_from_area` function to determine which power controls the unit within that area.
   - Specifically, it passes `main_area` as the `area_id` and `board_state` as is to `unit_power_from_area`.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If no unit is found in the specified province (i.e., `unit_type_from_area(area_id, board_state)` returns None), the function immediately returns `None`.
   - If a valid unit is present but its controlling power cannot be determined (i.e., none of the powers indicate control over the unit), a `ValueError` is raised with the message "Expected a unit there, but none of the powers indicated".

**Note**: Ensure that you import necessary modules and enums from `observation_utils.py`. Specifically, use `from observation_utils.py import ProvinceID, AreaID, NUM_POWERS, OBSERVATION_UNIT_POWER_START`.

**Output Example**: If a unit controlled by Power 3 is present in the specified province, the function will return `3`. For example:
```python
power_id = unit_power(province_id=5, board_state=np.array([[0, 0, 2], [0, 3, 0]]))
print(power_id)  # Output: 3

power_id = unit_power(province_id=7, board_state=np.array([[0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0]]))
print(power_id)  # Output: None
```

If no valid unit is found in the specified province, the function will return `None`. For example:
```python
power_id = unit_power(province_id=6, board_state=np.array([[0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0]]))
print(power_id)  # Output: None
```

This function plays a critical role in determining the controlling power of units within provinces, which is essential for various game logic operations such as movement and combat resolution. It relies on the `obs_index_start_and_num_areas` and `unit_power_from_area` functions to accurately determine the controlling power based on the current state of the board.
## FunctionDef unit_power_from_area(area_id, board_state)
**unit_power_from_area**: The function of unit_power_from_area is to determine the power responsible for a specific area on the game board.

**parameters**:
· area_id: AreaID - Represents the ID of the area where the unit's power needs to be identified.
· board_state: np.ndarray - A 2D array representing the current state of the game board, containing observation data for different areas and units.

**Code Description**: The function `unit_power_from_area` is designed to identify which player or faction has control over a particular area by examining the unit's power status within that area. It performs this task through the following steps:

1. **Initial Check with `unit_type_from_area`**: 
   - The function first calls `unit_type_from_area(area_id, board_state)`. This call checks if there is any unit present in the specified area by looking at specific indices within the `board_state` array. If no valid unit type is found (i.e., both army and fleet presence indicators are zero), it returns `None`.

2. **Power Identification**:
   - If a unit is confirmed to be present, the function iterates over all possible power IDs (`NUM_POWERS` iterations).
   - For each power ID, it checks if the corresponding power indicator in the `board_state` array for the given area is set to 1 (indicating presence). The relevant index is calculated as `OBSERVATION_UNIT_POWER_START + power_id`.
   - If a non-zero value is found at this index, indicating that a specific power has control over the unit, it returns the corresponding power ID.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If none of the powers are indicated for the area, even after checking all possible power IDs, the function raises a `ValueError` with the message "Expected a unit there, but none of the powers indicated". This ensures that any unexpected state is properly flagged.

This function is crucial because it helps in determining which player controls a unit within an area, facilitating further game logic such as movement, combat resolution, and resource management. It leverages the `unit_type_from_area` function to ensure that only valid units are considered before identifying their power.

**Note**: Ensure you import necessary modules and enums from `observation_utils.py`. Specifically, use `from observation_utils.py import AreaID, NUM_POWERS, OBSERVATION_UNIT_POWER_START`.

**Output Example**: If a unit controlled by Power 2 is present in the specified area, the function will return `2`. For example:
```python
power_id = unit_power_from_area(area_id=10, board_state=np.array([[0, 0, 2], [0, 3, 0]]))
print(power_id)  # Output: 2

power_id = unit_power_from_area(area_id=5, board_state=np.array([[0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0]]))
print(power_id)  # Output: None
```
If no valid unit is found at the specified area, the function will return `None`. For example:
```python
power_id = unit_power_from_area(area_id=7, board_state=np.array([[0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0]]))
print(power_id)  # Output: None
```

The function is also called by another function in the project, `unit_power`, which uses it to determine the controlling power of a unit within an area. This integration ensures that all relevant game state data is accurately reflected and processed.
## FunctionDef dislodged_unit_power(province_id, board_state)
**dislodged_unit_power**: The function of dislodged_unit_power is to return which power controls the unit province (None if no unit there).

**parameters**:
· parameter1: province_id (ProvinceID) - The id of the province.
· parameter2: board_state (np.ndarray) - A 2D array representing the current state of the game board, containing observation data for different areas and units.

**Code Description**: This function serves to determine which power controls a unit in a specific province by utilizing information from two helper functions: `obs_index_start_and_num_areas` and `dislodged_unit_power_from_area`.

1. **First Step - Determining the Main Area ID**: The function begins by calling `obs_index_start_and_num_areas(province_id)`, which returns the starting area ID (`main_area`) of the province and the total number of areas within it. This step is crucial for identifying where to look on the game board for a dislodged unit.
2. **Second Step - Finding the Dislodged Unit's Power**: With the `main_area` identified, the function calls `dislodged_unit_power_from_area(main_area, board_state)`. This call checks the specified area within the game board state to determine if there is a dislodged unit and which power controls it. If no unit exists in the area, this function returns None.

The relationship between these functions ensures that the overall logic of determining control over units in provinces remains consistent and accurate throughout the system. This approach helps maintain the integrity of the game's state by ensuring that all relevant information is correctly interpreted from the board state.

**Note**: Ensure you import `AreaID` and `ProvinceID` from the appropriate modules, as well as any necessary enums or constants related to unit types and powers. Also, make sure the `board_state` array structure matches the expected format for accurate results.

**Output Example**: If a dislodged unit of power 3 is present in province 5, the function will return 3. For example:
```python
power = dislodged_unit_power(province_id=5, board_state=np.array([[0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 3]]))
print(power)  # Output: 3

power = dislodged_unit_power(province_id=7, board_state=np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]]))
print(power)  # Output: None
```
## FunctionDef dislodged_unit_power_from_area(area_id, board_state)
**dislodged_unit_power_from_area**: The function of dislodged_unit_power_from_area is to determine the power associated with a unit that has been dislodged from its area on the game board.

**parameters**:
· area_id: AreaID - Represents the ID of the area where the dislodged unit is located.
· board_state: np.ndarray - A 2D array representing the current state of the game board, containing observation data for different areas and units.

**Code Description**: The function `dislodged_unit_power_from_area` checks if a unit exists in the specified area using the helper function `unit_type_from_area`. If no unit is found (i.e., the result from `unit_type_from_area` is None), it returns None. Otherwise, it iterates through all possible powers and returns the first power that indicates the presence of a dislodged unit in the given area.

The function ensures that only valid units are considered by checking specific indices within the `board_state` array for each potential power type. If no such index is found to be non-zero, indicating the absence of any dislodged unit, it raises a ValueError with an appropriate message.

This function is called by other functions within the project such as `dislodged_unit_power`. The `dislodged_unit_power` function uses this information to determine which power controls the unit in the specified province. This helps maintain consistency and accuracy in the game logic related to units and their powers.

**Note**: Ensure you import the necessary modules and enums from `observation_utils.py`. Specifically, use `from observation_utils.py import UnitType`.

**Output Example**: If a dislodged unit of power 2 is present at the specified area, the function will return 2. For example:
```python
power = dislodged_unit_power_from_area(area_id=10, board_state=np.array([[0, 0, 2], [0, 3, 0]]))
print(power)  # Output: 2

power = dislodged_unit_power_from_area(area_id=5, board_state=np.array([[0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0]]))
print(power)  # Output: None
```
If no valid unit is found at the specified area, it raises a ValueError with an appropriate message. For example:
```python
try:
    power = dislodged_unit_power_from_area(area_id=7, board_state=np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]))
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: Expected a unit there, but none of the powers indicated
```
## FunctionDef build_areas(country_index, board_state)
**build_areas**: The function of build_areas is to return all areas where it is legal for a power to build.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: country_index (int) - The index representing the power for which we are determining buildable areas.
· parameter2: board_state (np.ndarray) - A 2D NumPy array representing the current state of the game board.

**Code Description**: This function identifies all areas on the game board where a specific power can legally construct. It does this by filtering through the board_state, which contains information about each area's buildability and ownership status. Specifically:
- The first column starting from `OBSERVATION_SC_POWER_START` (which likely indicates the power index) is checked to ensure it has a positive value, meaning the area is owned by the specified power.
- The second column, `OBSERVATION_BUILDABLE`, is also checked for a positive value, ensuring the area is buildable.

The function uses `np.where()` and `np.logical_and()` to find areas where both conditions are met. Areas that do not meet these criteria (i.e., have zero values in either of the relevant columns) are excluded from the result.

This function serves as a foundational component for determining buildability, which is further refined by other functions like `build_provinces`. The output of this function provides the indices of all areas where the specified power can legally construct, enabling subsequent processes to focus on specific provinces within these areas.

**Note**: Ensure that `board_state` has the correct structure and dimensions as expected by this function. Pay attention to the constants `OBSERVATION_SC_POWER_START` and `OBSERVATION_BUILDABLE`, which should be defined elsewhere in your codebase or configuration files.

**Output Example**: Assuming a board_state array where each row represents an area, the return value might look like `[1, 3, 5]`, indicating that areas with indices 1, 3, and 5 are legal for building by the specified power.
## FunctionDef build_provinces(country_index, board_state)
**build_provinces**: The function of build_provinces is to return all provinces where it is legal for a power to build.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: country_index (int) - The index representing the power for which we are determining buildable provinces.
· parameter2: board_state (np.ndarray) - A 2D NumPy array representing the current state of the game board.

**Code Description**: This function identifies all provinces where a specific power can legally construct by leveraging the `build_areas` and `province_id_and_area_index` functions. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: An empty list named `buildable_provinces` is initialized to store the IDs of provinced that meet the buildability criteria.
2. **Iterate Over Areas**: The function iterates over each area where it is legal for the specified power to build, as determined by the `build_areas` function.
3. **Identify Province and Area Index**: For each valid area, the `province_id_and_area_index` function is called to get the province ID and the area index within that province.
4. **Filter Valid Provinces**: Only those provinces are added to the `buildable_provinces` list where both the area ownership and buildability conditions are met.

The relationship with its callees in the project:
- The `build_areas` function is called first to find all areas on the board that are owned by the specified power and are buildable.
- For each of these areas, the `province_id_and_area_index` function is used to map the area index back to its corresponding province ID.

**Note**: Ensure that the `board_state` array has the correct structure and dimensions as expected by this function. Pay attention to the constants `OBSERVATION_SC_POWER_START` and `OBSERVATION_BUILDABLE`, which should be defined elsewhere in your codebase or configuration files.

**Output Example**: The return value of `build_provinces` might look like `[1, 3, 5]`, indicating that provinces with IDs 1, 3, and 5 are legal for building by the specified power.
## FunctionDef sc_provinces(country_index, board_state)
**sc_provinces**: The function of sc_provinces is to return all supply centres that belong to a power.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: country_index (int) - The index representing the power whose supply centres are being queried.
· parameter2: board_state (np.ndarray) - The current state of the game board as observed.

**Code Description**: This function identifies and returns all provinces that serve as supply centres for a given power. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by using `np.where` to find all areas on the board where the specified power has control over at least one province (i.e., the value in the area's corresponding position in `board_state` is greater than 0).

2. **Iteration and Filtering**:
   - For each identified area (`a`), the function calls `province_id_and_area_index(a)` to get both the province ID and the area index.
   - If the area index is not 0, it skips this iteration, ensuring that only the main (non-coastal) areas of bicoastal provinces are considered. This step is crucial because supply centres are typically located in the main areas.

3. **Collection**: The province ID from each valid area is added to the `provinces` list.

4. **Return**: Finally, the function returns a list of all collected province IDs that represent the supply centres for the specified power.

The relationship with its callees (`province_id_and_area_index`) is significant. While `sc_provinces` itself does not directly handle coastal areas or manage supply centre properties, it relies on `province_id_and_area_index` to filter out non-main areas and correctly identify provinces that are supply centres.

**Note**: Ensure the input `board_state` accurately reflects the game state, particularly in terms of power control over different areas. Incorrect data can lead to incorrect identification of supply centres.

**Output Example**: If a power has control over two bicoastal provinces (each with main and coastal areas), and only one province is a supply centre, the function might return `[34]`, where 34 is the ID of that specific province.
## FunctionDef removable_areas(country_index, board_state)
**removable_areas**: The function of `removable_areas` is to identify all areas where it is legal for a power to remove.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `country_index` (int) - An integer representing the index of the country whose removable areas are being queried.
· parameter2: `board_state` (np.ndarray) - A NumPy array representing the current state of the board, where each element corresponds to a specific observation unit.

**Code Description**: The function `removable_areas` is designed to determine which areas can be legally removed based on the given `country_index` and the current `board_state`. It returns a sequence of area IDs that meet the criteria for removal. Specifically, an area is considered removable if:
1. The power in the corresponding observation unit (identified by `country_index + OBSERVATION_UNIT_POWER_START`) has a positive value.
2. The area itself is marked as removable (`board_state[:, OBSERVATION_REMOVABLE] > 0`).

The function uses NumPy's `np.where` to find all indices where both conditions are satisfied, effectively returning the IDs of these areas.

This function is called by another function in this module, `removable_provinces`. The relationship between `removable_areas` and `removable_provinces` can be understood as follows: `removable_provinces` leverages the results from `removable_areas` to filter out only those provinces (areas) that are considered the main province among multiple areas. This is achieved by iterating over the area IDs returned by `removable_areas`, extracting the province ID and area index, and filtering based on whether the area index is 0.

**Note**: Ensure that the input `board_state` array has been properly initialized with relevant observation data before calling this function. Additionally, verify that the constants `OBSERVATION_UNIT_POWER_START` and `OBSERVATION_REMOVABLE` are correctly defined in your project to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: Suppose we have a board state where `board_state[:, country_index + OBSERVATION_UNIT_POWER_START]` indicates the presence of powers, and `board_state[:, OBSERVATION_REMOVABLE]` marks removable areas. If `removable_areas(2, board_state)` is called with `country_index = 2`, it might return a sequence like `[10, 15, 30]`, indicating that area IDs 10, 15, and 30 are legal for removal according to the given conditions.
## FunctionDef removable_provinces(country_index, board_state)
**removable_provinces**: The function of removable_provinces is to identify all provinces where it is legal for a power to remove.
· parameter1: country_index (int) - An integer representing the index of the country whose removable provinces are being queried.
· parameter2: board_state (np.ndarray) - A NumPy array representing the current state of the board, where each element corresponds to a specific observation unit.

**Code Description**: The function `removable_provinces` is designed to determine which provinces can be legally removed based on the given `country_index` and the current `board_state`. To achieve this, it first calls another function `removable_areas(country_index, board_state)` to get all areas that are legal for removal. It then iterates over these area IDs to further filter out only those provinces (areas) that are considered the main province among multiple areas.

The process works as follows:
1. **Call `removable_areas`**: The function `removable_areas` is called with `country_index` and `board_state`. This returns a sequence of area IDs where it is legal for the specified power to remove an observation unit.
2. **Filter Main Provinces**: For each area ID returned by `removable_areas`, the function extracts the province ID and area index using the `np.where` method. It then filters out only those areas where the area index is 0, indicating that it is the main province among multiple areas.

The filtering logic ensures that only the primary provinces are considered for removal, even if there are multiple observation units associated with a single province.

**Note**: Ensure that the `board_state` array has been properly initialized with relevant observation data before calling this function. Additionally, verify that the constants `OBSERVATION_UNIT_POWER_START` and `OBSERVATION_REMOVABLE` are correctly defined in your project to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: Suppose we have a board state where `board_state[:, country_index + OBSERVATION_UNIT_POWER_START]` indicates the presence of powers, and `board_state[:, OBSERVATION_REMOVABLE]` marks removable areas. If `removable_provinces(2, board_state)` is called with `country_index = 2`, it might return a sequence like `[10, 35, 60]`, indicating that province IDs 10, 35, and 60 are legal for removal according to the given conditions.
