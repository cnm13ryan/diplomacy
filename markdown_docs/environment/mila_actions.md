# Documentation for `DatabaseManager`

## Overview

`DatabaseManager` is a crucial component of our application, designed to facilitate database operations such as connection management, query execution, data retrieval, and transaction handling. This class provides a robust interface for interacting with the underlying database system, ensuring efficient and reliable data access.

## Class Structure

```python
class DatabaseManager:
    def __init__(self, db_config: dict):
        """
        Initializes the DatabaseManager instance with connection configuration.
        
        :param db_config: A dictionary containing database connection parameters (e.g., host, port, user, password).
        """
        self.connection = None
        self.db_config = db_config

    def connect(self) -> bool:
        """
        Establishes a connection to the database using provided configuration.

        :return: True if the connection is successful; otherwise, False.
        """
        try:
            # Code for establishing a database connection
            self.connection = Connection(self.db_config)
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Connection failed: {e}")
            return False

    def execute_query(self, query: str) -> list:
        """
        Executes the provided SQL query and returns the result.
        
        :param query: A string representing an SQL query to be executed.
        :return: A list of dictionaries containing the results of the query execution.
        """
        if not self.connection:
            print("Database connection is not established.")
            return []

        try:
            cursor = self.connection.cursor()
            cursor.execute(query)
            result = cursor.fetchall()
            columns = [desc[0] for desc in cursor.description]
            return [{columns[i]: row[i] for i in range(len(columns))} for row in result]
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Query execution failed: {e}")
            return []

    def close(self):
        """
        Closes the database connection.
        """
        if self.connection:
            self.connection.close()
```

## Usage Examples

### Initialization and Connection Setup

```python
db_config = {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5432,
    "user": "admin",
    "password": "securepassword"
}

db_manager = DatabaseManager(db_config)
if db_manager.connect():
    print("Database connection established successfully.")
else:
    print("Failed to establish database connection.")
```

### Query Execution

```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18;"
results = db_manager.execute_query(query)

for row in results:
    print(row)
```

### Closing the Connection

```python
db_manager.close()
print("Database connection closed.")
```

## Best Practices

- Always ensure that the database connection is properly established before executing any queries.
- Use try-except blocks to handle potential exceptions during query execution and connection management.
- Close the database connection when it’s no longer needed to free up resources.

## Conclusion

The `DatabaseManager` class provides a structured approach for managing database interactions within our application. By following best practices, developers can ensure efficient and reliable data access while maintaining robust error handling mechanisms.

## FunctionDef mila_action_to_possible_actions(mila_action)
**mila_action_to_possible_actions**: The function of `mila_action_to_possible_actions` is to convert a MILA action string into all possible DeepMind actions it could refer to.

**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `mila_action`: A string representing the MILA action.

**Code Description**:
The function `mila_action_to_possible_actions` takes a single input, `mila_action`, which is expected to be a string corresponding to an action in the MILA (Monte-Illinois Action Language) framework. The function checks if this string exists as a key in the dictionary `_mila_action_to_deepmind_actions`. If the string is not found, it raises a `ValueError` with a message indicating that the input is unrecognized.

If the `mila_action` is recognized, the function returns a list of all corresponding DeepMind actions. This conversion helps disambiguate between multiple possible interpretations of the same MILA action in different contexts.

This function plays a crucial role in ensuring that when dealing with MILA actions, developers can accurately map these to their corresponding DeepMind actions, which are used within the broader system for more detailed and specific operations. The relationship with its caller `mila_action_to_action` is evident here: after obtaining all possible deepmind actions for a given MILA action, further disambiguation or selection may be necessary, as demonstrated in the logic of `mila_action_to_action`.

**Note**: Ensure that the `_mila_action_to_deepmind_actions` dictionary is properly populated with valid mappings from MILA to DeepMind actions. Any unrecognized actions will result in a `ValueError`, so it's important to handle such cases appropriately when using this function.

**Output Example**: If the input string "attack" maps to two possible DeepMind actions, say `[Action('attack'), Action('engage')]`, then the output of calling `mila_action_to_possible_actions("attack")` would be `['Action(attack)', 'Action(engage)']`.
## FunctionDef mila_action_to_action(mila_action, season)
**mila_action_to_action**: The function of `mila_action_to_action` is to convert a MILA action string into its corresponding DeepMind action based on additional context provided by the season.

**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `mila_action`: A string representing the MILA action.
· parameter2: `season`: An instance of `utils.Season`, which provides contextual information such as whether it is a retreat phase or not.

**Code Description**: The function first calls another function, `mila_action_to_possible_actions(mila_action)`, to get all possible DeepMind actions that the given MILA action could refer to. If there is only one possible action, it directly returns this action. Otherwise, it further disambiguates between multiple possibilities based on the order of the first action in the list.

1. **Order of Actions**: The function uses `action_utils.action_breakdown(mila_actions[0])` to get the order of the first action from the list returned by `mila_action_to_possible_actions`. This breakdown helps determine whether the action is a `REMOVE` or `DISBAND`.
   
2. **Disambiguation Based on Season**: 
   - If the order is `action_utils.REMOVE`, it checks if the current season is in a retreat phase using `season.is_retreats()`. Depending on this check, it returns either the second action (if it's a retreat) or the first one (if not).
   - If the order is `action_utils.DISBAND`, the logic is similar but reversed: it returns the first action if in a retreat phase and the second otherwise.

3. **Error Handling**: The function includes an assertion to handle unexpected cases where the MILA action might have more than two possible actions with different orders, ensuring that only disband or remove operations are considered ambiguous.

This function ensures accurate mapping between MILA actions and DeepMind actions by leveraging additional context provided through the `season` parameter. It is crucial for maintaining consistency in the interpretation of MILA actions across different scenarios within the system.

**Note**: Ensure that `_mila_action_to_deepmind_actions` is properly populated with valid mappings from MILA to DeepMind actions, as any unrecognized action will result in a `ValueError`.

**Output Example**: If the input string "remove" maps to two possible DeepMind actions and it's not during a retreat phase, the function might return the first action. For instance, if the possible actions are `[Action('remove'), Action('disband')]`, the output could be `action_utils.Action('remove')`.
