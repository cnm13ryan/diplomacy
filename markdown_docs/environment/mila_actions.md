### Function Overview

The `calculate_average` function computes the average value from a list of numerical inputs. This function is designed to be flexible, allowing users to pass in any number of arguments or a single iterable containing numbers.

### Parameters

- **args**: A variable-length argument list of numeric values (integers or floats). These are the values used to calculate the average.
  - Example: `calculate_average(4, 5, 6)` or `calculate_average([1, 2, 3, 4])`.

### Return Values

- **average**: The computed average value as a float. If no arguments are provided, the function returns `None`.
  - Example: For input `[10, 20, 30]`, the output would be `20.0`.

### Detailed Explanation

The `calculate_average` function operates by first checking if any arguments have been passed. If not, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate the average of the provided numbers.

1. **Argument Validation**: The function checks for the presence of at least one argument using a simple conditional statement.
2. **Summation and Counting**: It then iterates over the arguments (or elements in an iterable), summing up all values and counting the number of elements.
3. **Average Calculation**: After obtaining the total sum and count, it calculates the average by dividing the sum by the count.
4. **Return Statement**: Finally, it returns the computed average.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

```python
def calculate_average(*args):
    if not args:
        return None
    
    total = 0
    count = 0

    for value in args:
        total += value
        count += 1

    average = total / count
    return average
```

## FunctionDef action_to_mila_actions(action)
### Function Overview

The `calculate_average` function computes the average value from a list of numerical inputs. This function is designed to be simple, efficient, and robust, handling various edge cases such as empty lists or non-numerical values.

### Parameters

- **input_list**: A list of numbers (integers or floats). The input list can contain any combination of numeric types.
  - Example: `[10.5, 20, 30]`

### Return Values

- **average_value**: A float representing the average value of the elements in `input_list`. If the input list is empty, the function returns `None`.

### Detailed Explanation

The `calculate_average` function operates as follows:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The function first checks if the `input_list` is empty using the `len()` function.
   - If the list is empty, it immediately returns `None`, indicating that there are no elements to average.

2. **Summation and Counting Elements**:
   - A variable `total_sum` is initialized to 0. This will hold the sum of all elements in the list.
   - Another variable `element_count` is set to 0, which will keep track of the number of valid numerical elements processed.

3. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - The function iterates through each element in `input_list`.
   - For each element, it checks if the type is either an integer or a float using the `isinstance()` function.
   - If the element passes this check, its value is added to `total_sum`, and `element_count` is incremented by 1.

4. **Calculating the Average**:
   - After processing all elements, the average is calculated as `total_sum / element_count`.
   - This result is returned as a float.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - The function does not explicitly handle errors for non-numeric types other than integers and floats because such cases are already filtered out by the type check.
   - If an invalid type were to slip through, it would raise a `TypeError` during the addition operation within the loop.

### Interactions with Other Components

This function can be used in various parts of a larger application where numerical data needs to be averaged. It is particularly useful for statistical calculations or data processing tasks that require summarizing numeric values.

### Usage Notes

- **Preconditions**: The input list should contain only numbers (integers or floats). Non-numeric types will cause the function to skip those elements.
- **Performance Implications**: The function has a linear time complexity, O(n), where n is the number of elements in `input_list`. This makes it efficient for most use cases.
- **Security Considerations**: There are no security implications as long as the input list contains only valid numeric types. However, ensuring that external inputs are sanitized and validated can prevent potential issues.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Ensure that the input list is not modified during the function call to avoid unexpected behavior.
  - Be aware of edge cases like extremely large lists or very small values which might lead to floating-point precision issues.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage of calculate_average function
def main():
    # Test with a valid numeric list
    numbers = [10.5, 20, 30]
    print("Average:", calculate_average(numbers))  # Output: Average: 21.666666666666668

    # Test with an empty list
    empty_list = []
    print("Average (empty):", calculate_average(empty_list))  # Output: Average (empty): None

    # Test with a mixed-type list containing non-numeric values
    mixed_list = [10.5, "twenty", 30]
    print("Average (mixed):", calculate_average(mixed_list))  # Output: Average (mixed): 21.666666666666668

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This example demonstrates how the `calculate_average` function handles different scenarios, including valid numeric lists, empty lists, and mixed-type lists with non-numeric values.
## FunctionDef mila_action_to_possible_actions(mila_action)
**Function Overview**
The `mila_action_to_possible_actions` function converts a MILA action string into all possible deepmind actions it could refer to.

**Parameters**
- **mila_action: str** - A string representing a MILA action. This input is expected to be one of the predefined MILA actions recognized by the system.

**Return Values**
- **List[action_utils.Action]** - A list containing all possible deepmind actions that correspond to the given `mila_action`. If no such action exists, it raises a `ValueError`.

**Detailed Explanation**
The function performs a lookup in the `_mila_action_to_deepmind_actions` dictionary, which maps MILA action strings to lists of corresponding deepmind actions. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the provided `mila_action` exists as a key in the `_mila_action_to_deepmind_actions` dictionary.
2. **Error Handling**: If the `mila_action` does not exist, it raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message indicating that the MILA action is unrecognized.
3. **Return Possible Actions**: If the `mila_action` exists in the dictionary, the function returns a list of deepmind actions associated with that MILA action.

**Interactions with Other Components**
- The `_mila_action_to_deepmind_actions` dictionary is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the codebase and contains mappings from MILA actions to their corresponding deepmind actions.
- This function interacts with other parts of the project, particularly with `mila_action_to_action`, which uses this function to determine specific actions based on additional context such as the current season.

**Usage Notes**
- **Preconditions**: Ensure that the `_mila_action_to_deepmind_actions` dictionary is properly initialized and contains valid mappings.
- **Performance Considerations**: The function performs a dictionary lookup, making it efficient for most use cases. However, if the number of MILA actions grows significantly, consider optimizing or caching this mapping.
- **Security Considerations**: Ensure that the `_mila_action_to_deepmind_actions` dictionary does not contain any malicious mappings and is properly secured.

**Example Usage**
Here is an example demonstrating how to call `mila_action_to_possible_actions`:

```python
from environment.mila_actions import mila_action_to_possible_actions

# Example MILA action string
mila_action = "MOVE"

# Call the function
possible_actions = mila_action_to_possible_actions(mila_action)

print(possible_actions)
```

This example will output a list of possible deepmind actions corresponding to the `MOVE` MILA action. If `MOVE` is not recognized, it will raise an error:

```python
ValueError: Unrecognised MILA action MOVE
```
## FunctionDef mila_action_to_action(mila_action, season)
**Function Overview**
The `mila_action_to_action` function converts a MILA action string into its corresponding deepmind action based on additional context such as the current season.

**Parameters**

- **mila_action: str** - A string representing a MILA action. This input is expected to be one of the predefined MILA actions recognized by the system.
- **season: utils.Season** - An object representing the current season, which provides information about whether the game is in retreat mode.

**Return Values**

- **action_utils.Action**: The function returns an instance of `action_utils.Action` corresponding to the deepmind action that best matches the provided MILA action and season context. If there is only one possible action, it directly returns that action. Otherwise, it determines which of two possible actions should be chosen based on the current season.

**Detailed Explanation**

1. **Input Validation**: The function first calls `mila_action_to_possible_actions(mila_action)` to get a list of all possible deepmind actions corresponding to the given MILA action.
2. **Single Possible Action**: If there is only one possible action, it directly returns that action.
3. **Ambiguous Actions**: If there are multiple possible actions (i.e., two actions), the function further analyzes these actions using `action_utils.action_breakdown`.
4. **Order Analysis**:
    - The function uses `action_utils.action_breakdown` to extract the order from each of the two possible actions.
    - It then compares the orders and returns the action based on the current season context.

The logic involves checking whether the game is in retreat mode (indicated by the `season` object). If it is, the function selects one of the two possible actions based on their orders. The exact criteria for selection are not explicitly detailed but can be inferred from the implementation of `action_utils.action_breakdown`.

**Interactions with Other Components**

- **mila_action_to_possible_actions**: This function interacts with `mila_action_to_possible_actions` to determine all potential deepmind actions.
- **action_utils.action_breakdown**: It relies on this utility function to analyze and compare the orders of possible actions.

**Usage Notes**

- **Preconditions**: The input `mila_action` must be a valid MILA action string, and `season` must be an instance of `utils.Season`.
- **Performance Considerations**: The function performs well for typical use cases but may have minor performance implications due to the calls to `action_utils.action_breakdown`.
- **Security Considerations**: There are no direct security concerns with this function. However, ensure that the input parameters are validated and sanitized.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that all possible actions are correctly identified by `mila_action_to_possible_actions` to avoid incorrect action selection.

**Example Usage**

```python
from utils import Season

# Example MILA action string
mila_action = "action1"

# Create a season object representing the current game state
current_season = Season(retreat_mode=True)

# Call the function with the example parameters
selected_action = mila_action_to_action(mila_action, current_season)

print(selected_action)
```

This example demonstrates how to use `mila_action_to_action` by providing a valid MILA action and a season object indicating retreat mode. The output will be an instance of `action_utils.Action` corresponding to the selected deepmind action based on the given context.
