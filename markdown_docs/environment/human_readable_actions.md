## FunctionDef area_string(area_tuple)
**area_string**: The function of `area_string` is to convert an area tuple into its corresponding string representation based on province ID.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: `area_tuple`: A tuple containing the province ID and coast number, where the province ID corresponds to a unique identifier for a province in the game state. This data type is defined as `utils.ProvinceWithFlag`.

**Code Description**: The function `area_string` takes an area tuple (which includes a province ID) and returns a string representation of that province using the `_province_id_to_tag` dictionary, which maps province IDs to their corresponding tags. This function is fundamental for generating human-readable strings related to areas in the game state.

This function is utilized by several other functions within the `action_string` and `area_string_with_coast_if_fleet` methods. Specifically:
- **Relationship with `action_string`**: The `unit_string` variable in the `action_string` function calls `area_string`, which provides a basic string representation of the unit's area.
- **Relationship with `area_string_with_coast_if_fleet`**: Both functions are used to generate strings for areas, but `area_string_with_coast_if_fleet` takes additional parameters to handle specific cases involving fleets and coast annotations.

**Note**: Ensure that the input tuple provided to `area_string` is correctly formatted as a `utils.ProvinceWithFlag`, otherwise, it may lead to incorrect string representations. Also, make sure that `_province_id_to_tag` is properly initialized with valid mappings for all province IDs.

**Output Example**: If `area_tuple = (1024, 1)` and `_province_id_to_tag[1024] = 'A'`, then the function will return `'A'`.
## FunctionDef area_string_with_coast_if_fleet(area_tuple, unit_type)
**area_string_with_coast_if_fleet**: The function of `area_string_with_coast_if_fleet` is to generate a string representation of an area with coast annotations if there is a fleet present and the province is bicoastal.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: `area_tuple`: A tuple containing the province ID and coast number, where the province ID corresponds to a unique identifier for a province in the game state. This data type is defined as `utils.ProvinceWithFlag`.
· parameter2: `unit_type`: An optional parameter representing the unit type (e.g., fleet or army), which defaults to `None`.

**Code Description**: The function `area_string_with_coast_if_fleet` checks if a province with a given ID and coast number should have its coast annotations updated based on the presence of a specific unit type. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Initial Checks**: The function first verifies whether the province ID is less than a predefined threshold (`utils.SINGLE_COASTED_PROVINCES`) or if the `unit_type` is an army. If either condition holds, it directly returns the result from the standard `area_string` function.
2. **Fleet in Bicoastal Province**: If the province is bicoastal and contains a fleet (`unit_type == utils.UnitType.FLEET`), the function retrieves the province tag using `_province_id_to_tag[province_id]`. It then appends 'NC' if there are no coasts or 'SC' if there is at least one coast.
3. **Unknown Unit Type**: If the `unit_type` is unknown (`unit_type is None`), the function behaves similarly to the previous case but uses a placeholder string `'maybe_NC'` when no coasts are present, indicating uncertainty about the fleet's presence.
4. **Return Value**: The function returns the constructed string representation of the province with appropriate coast annotations.

**Note**: Ensure that the `utils.SINGLE_COASTED_PROVINCES` constant and `_province_id_to_tag` dictionary are properly defined elsewhere in your codebase to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: For a bicoastal province (e.g., ID 5) containing a fleet, the function might return "P5SC" if there is at least one coast. If no coasts are present, it would return "P5NC". If the unit type is an army or unknown, the standard `area_string` representation will be returned without any coast annotations.

### Object: `User`

#### Overview

The `User` object is a fundamental entity used to represent individual users within our application. It encapsulates various attributes and methods necessary for managing user information securely and efficiently.

#### Properties

- **ID**: Unique identifier for the user.
- **Name**: The full name of the user.
- **Email**: The email address associated with the user account.
- **PasswordHash**: A hashed version of the user's password, stored securely.
- **PhoneNumber**: The phone number of the user (optional).
- **Address**: User’s physical or mailing address (optional).
- **Roles**: An array of roles that the user belongs to. Each role can define specific permissions and access levels within the application.
- **CreatedOn**: Timestamp indicating when the user account was created.
- **LastLogin**: Timestamp recording the last time the user logged in.

#### Methods

- **CreateUser**: A method used to create a new `User` object with specified details. It also handles hashing the password before storing it.
- **UpdateUser**: Updates an existing `User` object with new information, such as name or address.
- **Authenticate**: Verifies if a given email and password match those stored in the system.
- **AssignRole**: Assigns one or more roles to a user. This method is used for role-based access control (RBAC).
- **RemoveRole**: Removes one or more roles from a user, adjusting their permissions accordingly.

#### Example Usage

```python
# Creating a new User object
new_user = User(
    name="John Doe",
    email="john.doe@example.com",
    password="securepassword123",
    phone_number="+1-555-1234"
)

# Updating user information
user.updateUser(name="Jane Doe", address="123 Main St, Anytown")

# Authenticating a user
if User.authenticate(email="john.doe@example.com", password="securepassword123"):
    print("Authentication successful.")
else:
    print("Invalid credentials.")

# Assigning roles to a user
user.assignRole(["admin", "editor"])

# Removing roles from a user
user.removeRole("admin")
```

#### Security Considerations

- **Password Management**: Always use secure hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) for storing passwords.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure that sensitive data, such as addresses and phone numbers, are handled with appropriate privacy measures.
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control to manage user permissions effectively.

#### Conclusion

The `User` object is a critical component in our application, providing robust management of user information and ensuring secure authentication. Proper use of the methods provided can help maintain data integrity and security while facilitating seamless user interactions within the system.
