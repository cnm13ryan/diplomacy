## FunctionDef area_string(area_tuple)
**area_string**: The function of area_string is to return a string representation of a given province based on its identifier.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· area_tuple: a tuple containing the province identifier and other relevant information, typed as utils.ProvinceWithFlag
**Code Description**: This function takes an area_tuple as input and returns a string corresponding to the province identifier in the _province_id_to_tag dictionary. It is used by other functions in the project, such as area_string_with_coast_if_fleet and action_string, to provide human-readable representations of provinces. In the context of area_string_with_coast_if_fleet, it serves as a fallback when the unit type is not a fleet or when the province is not bicoastal. In the action_string function, it is used to generate strings for various actions, such as hold, move, and support, by providing the string representation of the involved provinces.
**Note**: The function relies on the _province_id_to_tag dictionary, which maps province identifiers to their corresponding tags. It assumes that the input area_tuple contains a valid province identifier. If the identifier is not found in the dictionary, the function may raise an exception or return an incorrect result.
**Output Example**: For a given area_tuple containing the province identifier "123", the function might return the string "PROV123", where "PROV" is the prefix for provinces and "123" is the identifier. The actual output will depend on the contents of the _province_id_to_tag dictionary.
## FunctionDef area_string_with_coast_if_fleet(area_tuple, unit_type)
**area_string_with_coast_if_fleet**: The function of area_string_with_coast_if_fleet is to return a string representation indicating coasts when a fleet is in a bicoastal province.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· area_tuple: a tuple containing the province identifier and other relevant information, typed as utils.ProvinceWithFlag
· unit_type: an optional parameter representing the type of unit, typed as Optional[utils.UnitType]
**Code Description**: This function takes an area_tuple and a unit_type as input and returns a string representation based on the province identifier and unit type. If the province is not bicoastal or the unit type is an army, it calls the area_string function to return the string representation of the province. If the unit type is a fleet, it appends 'NC' or 'SC' to the province tag to indicate the coast. If the unit type is unknown, it appends 'maybe_NC' or 'SC' to the province tag. The function relies on the _province_id_to_tag dictionary to map province identifiers to their corresponding tags.
The area_string_with_coast_if_fleet function is used by the action_string function to generate human-readable action strings, particularly for actions involving fleets in bicoastal provinces. For example, when generating a string for a move-to action, the action_string function calls area_string_with_coast_if_fleet to get the string representation of the destination province with coast information.
**Note**: The function assumes that the input area_tuple contains a valid province identifier and that the unit type is either an army or a fleet. If the unit type is invalid, it raises a ValueError. Additionally, the function relies on the _province_id_to_tag dictionary to be populated with the correct mappings of province identifiers to their corresponding tags.
**Output Example**: For a given area_tuple containing the province identifier "123" and a unit_type of utils.UnitType.FLEET, the function might return the string "PROV123NC", where "PROV123" is the prefix for provinces and "123" is the identifier, and "NC" indicates the north coast. If the unit type is unknown, it might return "PROV123maybe_NC". The actual output will depend on the contents of the _province_id_to_tag dictionary and the input parameters.
## FunctionDef action_string(action, board)
**action_string**: The function of action_string is to return a human-readable string representation of a given action.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· action: The action to be converted into a human-readable string, which can be either an action_utils.Action or an action_utils.ActionNoIndex.
· board: An optional parameter representing the game board as a numpy array, used to determine whether units are fleets or not for coast annotations.
**Code Description**: This function takes an action and an optional board as input, breaks down the action into its components using the action_utils.action_breakdown function, and then generates a human-readable string based on the action type. The function uses the area_string and area_string_with_coast_if_fleet functions to generate string representations of provinces involved in the action. For example, if the action is a move-to action, the function will call area_string_with_coast_if_fleet to get the string representation of the destination province with coast information if the unit is a fleet. The function supports various action types, including hold, convoy, move-to, support, and others.
**Note**: The function assumes that the input action is valid and can be broken down into its components using the action_utils.action_breakdown function. If the board is not provided, the function will not include coast information in the generated string. Additionally, the function relies on the area_string and area_string_with_coast_if_fleet functions to generate accurate string representations of provinces.
**Output Example**: For a given action representing a move-to action by a fleet from province "123" to province "456", the function might return the string "PROV123 - PROV456NC", where "PROV123" is the string representation of the source province, "PROV456" is the string representation of the destination province, and "NC" indicates the north coast. The actual output will depend on the specific action and board configuration.
